This repository contains LaTeX and image files to generate a corrected version of the first edition of the textbook Mathematical Phyllotaxis. A limited first printing of the first edition with ISBN 978-0-9931789-6-2 was published by Infang Publishing in September 2023.

It is my current intention to produce a second edition late in 2024, likely to incorporate additional material from [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05857] among other sources, together with a release of the Mathematica code used to generate the images. Please let me have any comments at jonathan@swintons.net.
