This repository contains LaTeX and image files to generate the most up to date edition of the textbook _Mathematical Phyllotaxis_. 

A limited first printing of the first edition with ISBN 978-0-9931789-6-2 was published by Infang Publishing in September 2023. 

A peer-reviewed (thanks, peers!), corrected and improved second edition is [now being advertised by by Springer Nature](https://link.springer.com/book/ 9783031940125)  in both print (978-3-031-94012-5) and eBook (978-3-031-94013-2) versions. Springer say these will be appearing in November 2025, although as of September 2025 the production has sailed blithely   past four promised deadlines over six months, so who knows. They have, though removed all the final full stops from every single figure caption, because that's apparently an important house style (sorry, peers, if you are not sure whether the caption is truncated in error 

I have granted an exclusive copyright license to that second edition to Springer Nature.  For that reason this repository does not contain the PDF of the current edition of the book, and I do not have the source files as edited by Springer. This repository contains my uncorrected and unreviewed work in progress towards a third edition and is not suitable for classroom or research use. 

Please let me have any comments at jonathan@swintons.net.
