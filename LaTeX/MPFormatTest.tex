Mark and Ang Davis extended an invitation to give a talk in the pub for Bollington Science Festival in 2012 which started me wondering why it wasn't possible to explain to the citizens of Bollington why plants had Fibonacci numbers, even though Ian Stewart had written twenty years earlier that this was a mathematically solved problem. Around the same time, Erinma Ochu, then of the MOSI Turing's Sunflowers project was amazed that no-one knew how to breed Lucas sunflowers.
