	The grocery proof is left as an exercise to the reader. If using the Linford pineapple, there are clearly 8 spirals going up and to the right; depending on how the scales as the edges were originally joined there are either 12 or 13 spirals up and to the left. 
}\end{sol}

\begin{sol}{ex:doitagain}{
Based on the consistent jumps between adjacent numbered scales (eg in Fig 1, from 22 to 26 to 40 to 34 is evidence of four separate spirals), I would say these cones display evidence of 4 and 7 spirals (Fig 1); 7 and 11 (Fig 2); 7 and 10 (Fig 4a). Based on the scale numbering alone, I can't assign an unambiguous spiral count  for Fig 3.

\begin{sol}{ex:fareyFpair}  {
For  $k=1$, the mediant of the Farey interval $(u+v)/(m+n)$ is $F_j/F_{j+2}$. 
Generalised Fibonacci number pairs, such as the Lucas numbers $F^3_4=7$ and $F^3_5=11$, also appear in Figure~\ref{fig:Txb0301EuclideanTree}. From inspection of the tree or by induction we have for $k>1$
\begin{align}
	\begin{pmatrix} 
		F^k_{j+1} & F_j

		F^k_j & F_{j-1}
	\end{pmatrix} &= 	(E\cdot  S)^{j-1} \cdot  (E^k S) 
	\label{eq:GeneralizedFibonacciMatrix}
\end{align}
(This is still true for $k=1$ but as we have seen delivers a B\'ezout pair but not the winding-number pair). For these generalised pairs the Farey mediant is 
\begin{align}
	\frac{	 F_j + F_{j-1}}{F^k_{j+1}+F^k_{j}}&=	\frac{	 F_{j+1}}{F^k_{j+2}}

		\\&= \frac{ F_{j+1}/F_{j}}{1+ k F_{j+1}/F_{j}}

making use of the well-known relation $	F^k_{j+1} =   k F_j+ F_{j-1}$. Finally we use $\lim_{ k\tends \infty}  F_{j+1}/F_{j}=\tau$ together with the fact that the Farey intervals are nested.

	The generating interval for $1,1$ is empty, since $\gp{1,1}$ is never generating, but the complementary-generating interval is the whole $d$-interval, since \gphat{1}{1} is always generating.
For $m=1$, $n=2$, Exercise~\ref{ex:calcdelta} shows that the generating interval is $[\jfrac{1}{4},\jhalf]$ and the complementary-generating interval is the whole $d$-interval.
For $m=1$ and $n>2$,  Exercise~\ref{ex:calcdelta} shows the generating interval is the $d$ such that $[nd]=1$, which is $2nd\in [1,3]$.  
The complementary pair is generating either when (a) $[nd]=0$, which requires $2nd<1$ or (b) when both $[nd]=2$ (so $2nd\in [3,5]$) and $nd<[nd]=2$,
so (b) requires $2nd\in[3,4]$. These two possibilities flank the generating interval.

	As $k$ becomes large and odd, $I_k$ tends to the point $\lim F_k/F_{k+1}=1/\tau$.
	If $k$ is even, the winding number pair is $F_{k-2}$,$F_{k-1} = F_{k}-F_{k-1},F_{k+1}-F_k$ which we recognise as giving us the interval $1-I_k$ for $[md]=u$ and $[nd]=v$ instead.

\begin{sol}{ex:ftpfail}{
	In Theorem~\ref{thm:fundamentalcorresponding} the vectors are restricted to be parastichy vectors, but to find two generating and opposed vectors  with $m=1$ and $n=1$ we must allow complementary vectors and take $\pvec{1}$ and $\phatvec{1}$. 
	These are always generating and opposed and so the generating interval is $[0,1]$. 
	Either B\'ezout pair of $u=1, v=0$ or $u=0,v=1$ allows this to be written as $[u/m,v/n]$ in some order.
	
	Suppose that $m=1$ and $n>1$. If $dn<\jhalf$, then $\pvec{1}$ and $\pvec{n}$ are co-linear, so instead pay attention to the pair $\pvec{1}$ and $\phatvec{n}$. For $d$ small and positive this pair is generating and opposed, and remains so until $dn=\jhalf$ at which point the horizontal component of $\pvec{n}$ increases through $\jhalf$ and jumps back down to $-\jhalf$ so that  $\pvec{n}$ is no longer co-linear with $\pvec{1}$. As $d$ continues to increase, the new pair $\pvec{1}$ and $\pvec{n}$ remain generating and opposed until
	 $\pvec{n}$ becomes vertical, which happens when $nd=1$. After this the pair is no longer opposed.
	 	 For $m=1$ amd $n>1$, the winding-number pair is $u=0$ and $v=1$, corresponding to a Farey interval of $[0,1/n]$. Thus this is the interval on which the lattice has an opposed generating pair, but below the midpoint $d<1/2n$, the pair is of a parastichy vector and a complementary vector.

\begin{sol}{ex:pdiv}{
	We set $m=55=F_j$ and $89=n=F_j$ with $j=10$, and use $u=F_9=34$, $v=F_{10}=55$ to give $mv-nu=(-1)^{11}$ as expected.
	The interval in $[0,\jhalf]$ is $1-(34/55,55/89)= 1/\tau^2+ [-0.00014\ldots, 0.0005\ldots]$.
	Thus the divergence angle of such a lattice must be within less than 2 parts in a thousand of the golden angle.

\begin{sol}{ex:pspiral}{
For $h$ large enough, 	the shortest vector in the lattice is  $\pvec{0}=(1,0)$ 
of length 1, and the second shortest is  $\pvec{1}=(h,d)$ of length $h^2+d^2$.
These change relative magnitude when $h^2+d^2=1$ giving us a $(1,0)$ lattice.
As $h$ decreases further, there is a point when  $\phatvec{1}=(h,d-1)$ is of equal length to $\pvec{0}$: this is when $h^2+d^2=2d$. These give the boundaries between the $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$ and $(1,\hat 1)$ regions in Figure~\ref{fig:Txb0501VanItersonMain}. 

As $h$ continues to decrease, but as long as $\pvec{1}$ remains the shortest vector in the lattice, the second shortest
must be on the adjacent 1-parastichy to the origin. Given the definition of $k=\lfloor1/2d\rfloor-1\geq 1$, $1/2(k+1)<d\leq 1/2k$,  and then $\pvec{2},\ldots,\pvec{k}$ are co-linear with $\pvec{1}$ on the origin parastichy, so they are not the second shortest principal vector. On the adjacent 1-parastichy, though, we can set $\rpvec{n}=  (nd-1,n h)$, and we have $\phatvec{n}=\rpvec{n}=\pvec{n}-\pvec{0}$ for $-k\leq n\leq k$ and $\pvec{n}=\rpvec{n}$ for $k+1\leq n\leq 2k+1$. Then the second principal vector is one of these $\rpvec{}$s and specifically it is the one closest to $\mathbf{n}$: the vector which normal to the origin 1-parastichy from the origin to the adjacent 1-parastichy: see Figure~\ref{fig:Txb0412Spiral}.

and $(1,6)$.  The normal to the 1-parastichy is shown as a thin line. For large enough $h$, as in the first two cases, one of the principal vectors is a complementary vector. }{1.0}
%

We have $\pvec{1}=(d,h)$; so $\mathbf{n}$  has slope $-d/h$. Since   $\mathbf{n}$ and $\pvec{1}$
must form a rectangle of area $h$, we can find the length of  $\mathbf{n}$ and discover  $\mathbf{n} = \nu (-h^2 /d,h)$
where 
$
	\nu = 
	%\frac
	{d}/{(h^2+d^2)}
$
Since the rise of $\mathbf{n}$ is $h\nu$, it passes through one of the $r_n$ every time $\nu$ passes through an integer,
and the closest  $\mathbf{r}_n$ has $n=[\nu]$, so that the second principal vector changes from $\rpvec{n}$ to 
$\rpvec{n+1}$  when $\nu=n+\jhalf$ which can be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
{h^2+\left(d-\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)^2}=  \frac{1}{(2n+1)^2}
\end{equation}
Note that for the initial case $n=0$ we recover $h^2+d^2=2d$ as the $0=\hat{1}$ boundary where a $(1,0)$ lattice became a $(1,\hat 1)$ lattice. For each of $n=1,\ldots,k$ this gives the point at which a  $(1,\hat n)$ becomes a  $(1,\widehat {n+1})$ lattice, and then for $n=k+1$ the lattice transitions from a  $(1,\hat {k})$ to a $(1, {k+1})$ lattice.  From this point on the principal pair are both parastichy vectors, though at some yet smaller $h$.  $\pvec{1}$ will cease to be the principal vector and we are back in the full complexity of Figure~\ref{fig:Txb0501VanItersonMain}.

	They must lie on a circle because the M\"obius map takes vertical lines in the complex plane into circles and indeed
	\begin{align}
		\left( d(s)- \frac{1+2nu}{2mn}\right)^2 + h(s)^2 &= \frac{1}{4 m^2 n^2}.
	\end{align}

\begin{sol}{ex:shcircles}
Touching circle lattices occur in \gp{0,1} space when $w=e^{i\theta}$, for $\pi/3\leq\theta\leq2\pi/3$ and $\theta$ is the angle between the principal vectors. 
Equations~\eqref{eq:rez} and~\eqref{eq:gReIBm} give the divergence and rise of the lattice transformed by $\Delta g_{mn}$ as 
\begin{align}
	d(\theta) &= 
	\Delta \frac{n v + m u	- \cos\theta ( n u + m v)}{m^2-2 \cos \theta mn +n^2   } 
	\\
	h(\theta) &=
	\frac{	\sin\theta}{m^2-2 \cos \theta mn +n^2   }
	\label{eq:tchd}
\end{align}

For a square touching circle lattice, $\theta=\pi/2$ and 
\begin{align}
	d &= \Delta \frac{ m u +  n v   }{m^2 +  n^2},
	\\
	h  &= \frac{1}{m^2 + n^2}.
\end{align}

There are two hexagonal lattice points in \gp{0,1} at $e^{i\pi/3}$ and $e^{2i\pi/3}$ which map to different hexagonal lattices corresponding to principal parastichies  $(m,n,n+m)$ or  $(m,n-m,n)$. For $w= e^{i\pi/3}$ we get
	\begin{align}
	d &= \Delta \frac{ m u +  n v- (n u + mv)/2   }{m^2 + m n + n^2},
	\\
	h  &= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{1}{\left(m^2 -  mn +n^2 \right)}  .
	\end{align}
	
\end{sol}

\begin{sol}{ex:calcprinciplay}
The angle  $\theta$ between the principal parastichy vectors is the same in the $\gp{0,1}$ lattice and in the rotated and scaled lattice, and  $w=|w_0|e^{i\theta}$.  Inserting this into in~\eqref{eq:gReImA} and taking real and imaginary parts allows the calculation of $\pvec{m}=m z_1 -u$ and $|\pvec{m}|^2$: 
	\begin{align}
	|\pvec{m}|^2 &=\frac{1}{m^2 w_0^2-2 m n w_0 \cos (\theta )+n^2}.
		\end{align}
	
		
For a touching circle lattice, $w_0=1$ and $4r^2=	|\pvec{m}|^2$ so the radius of the touching circles (not the radius of the circle in van Iterson space where lattices are touching circles!) is
\begin{align}
4 r^{2}  &=\frac{1}{ m^2-2 m n \cos (\theta )+n^2}.
\\
&= \frac{h(\theta)}{\sin \theta}
\end{align}
Eliminating $\cos\theta$ between this and~\eqref{eq:tchd} gives
\begin{align}
d&=		\jhalf
\left(\frac{u}{m}+\frac{v}{n}\right)
+ 2\Delta  \left(\frac{n}{m}-\frac{m}{n}\right)r^2
\end{align}

As $w_1$ rotates around the unit circle from $e^{2i\pi/3}$ to $e^{i\pi/2}$ to $e^{i\pi/3}$, the inverse square diameter of the transformed lattice increases from $m^2-mn+n^2$at the top triple point on the $m=n$ branch, through  $m^2+n^2$ at the square lattice point, down to $m^2+mn+n^2$  at the lower triple point.

\begin{sol}{ex:fibthresholds}{
If $m$ and $n$ are adjacent Fibonacci numbers $F_{k}$ and $F_{k+1}$, then using $F_k\approx \tau^k/\sqrt{5}
$ we find the value of $r$ on the branch is approximately
	\begin{align}
  F_k \sqrt{2} &\leq	2 r^{-1}  \leq F_k \sqrt{2(1+\tau)}.
\end{align}
So on the Fibonacci branch of the van Iterson diagram, 
the larger Fibonacci number becomes $F_{k+1}$ at approximately $r=\sqrt{5/2}\tau^{-k}\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}F_k}$.
}\end{sol}

\begin{sol}{ex:crvani}{
		From~\eqref{eq:tchd}, the imaginary part of $z_1$ is zero when  $\sin\theta=0$, so the left and right intersections of the image of $w$ on the real axis are in some order $(u-v)/(m-n)$ and $(u+v)/(m+n)$ so that the radius of the van Iterson circle
		is
\begin{align}	
			v_r &= \frac{1}{n^2-m^2}
\end{align}
and it is centred at
\begin{align}			v_0 &= \frac{|m u - n v|}{n^2-m^2}
\end{align}	so that $z_1=\Delta v_0 + v_r e^{i\psi}$. 
A bit more work shows
\begin{align}
	\tan \psi &= \frac{ (n^2-m^2)\sin \theta}{(m^2+n^2)\cos\theta-2mn}
	\\
	&= \frac{ (n^2-m^2)}{n^2-2mn/\cos\theta+m^2}\tan\theta
\end{align}
The hexagonal points are when $\cos\theta=\pm\sqrt{3}/2$ and $\sin\theta=1/2$, so
\begin{align}
	\tan \psi 
	&= \frac{ (n^2-m^2)}{\pm\sqrt{3}(n^2+m^2)-mn }
\end{align}
}

\begin{sol}{ex:whenno}{
		The bifurcation theory argument of this chapter or specifically examination of Figure~\ref{fig:Txb0505Pruned} show we must have $n-m>m$ or $ m < \jhalf n$. If this is true, 
		the lattice is non-opposed  on the $\gp{m=n}$ branch from the triple point $\gp{m=n=n-m}$ to the point where either $\pvec{m}$ or $\pvec{n}$ vector becomes vertical.

			Choose $u,v$ as the winding number pair so that $m v - n u=\Delta$. We need either $\Re \pvec{m}=0$, so $\Re z_1=u/m$ or $\Re \pvec{n}=0$, so $\Re z_1=v/n$. This gives $\cos\theta=n/m$ or $\cos\theta=m/n$ respectively, so we need to choose $\cos\theta=m/n$,
			and since $m/n<\jhalf$, $\pi/3\leq\theta\leq 2\pi/3$ and one of the solutions of  $\cos\theta=m/n$ is indeed a point on the touching circle
			 branch. From the previous exercise $\tan\psi=-\tan\theta$ at that point, 
			 and so $|\cos\psi|=m/n$ there too.

	Lagrange proved in 1773 that a hexagonal lattice is the closest possible lattice packing, and triple-points are the only points in lattice space at which the lattice is hexagonal.

\begin{sol}{ex:richards}{
	The first result itself follows
	from reading the rise of a lattice from~\eqref{eq:gReImA}, combined with observing that Fibonacci numbers scale like $\tau^k$
	and so $h$ scales like $n^{-2}$. 
	
The exercise is to warn the reader against trying to make too much sense of the following strange expression which appeared in
	\autocite{richardsPhyllotaxisItsQuantitative1951}:
	\begin{align}
		k\approx \mbox{P.I} &= 0.33 - 2.39 \log_{10}  \log_{10} R.
		\label{eq:richards}
	\end{align}
	 Richards wanted to fit real disk patterns as idealisations of those on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:Txb0603Transforms}. He  
	 seems to have assumed an orthogonal golden lattice transformed with logarithmic spirals, and his unfortunate idea was to use the $R$ of equation~\eqref{eq:plastoratio} to estimate $h$, which gives one $\log$ in equation~\ref{eq:richards}, and then use the knowledge of how $h$ scaled with $k$ to estimate $k$, giving another $\log$ in that equation. The specific numerical values of the coefficients in equation~\eqref{eq:plastoratio} depend on exactly what lattice is being imagined as the precursor. The argument in~	\autocite{richardsPhyllotaxisItsQuantitative1951} is not easy to follow mathematically, creating an opportunity for several subsequent papers to attempt a more rigorous formulation~\autocite{thornleyPhyllotaxisIIDescription1975,jeanBib647,jeanBib278}.

Quite apart from the problems inherent in a $\log \log$, term, estimates of $R$ will be in practice very sensitive  to the estimate of position of the unknown centre of the disk. Even if the plastochrone ratio $R$ can be reliably estimated from the observed pattern then it seems much, much,  simpler to just count the $k$. But more fundamentally the Richards plastochrone index just assumes too much to discriminate between different developmental models.
