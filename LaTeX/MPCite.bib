  abstract = {To determine the consequences of contact pressure in phyllotaxis, a mathematical model is constructed in which a leaf distribution is represented by a point lattice of n + 1 lattice points at equal intervals on a helix wound around a cylinder. The model is normalized by taking the girth of the cylinder as 1 and by measuring time T in plastochrones, so that n = [T]. r stands for the normalized internode distance (component of the distance between two consecutive lattice points that is parallel to the axis of the cylinder). d stands for the divergence (fraction of a turn between consecutive lattice points). It is assumed that r is a monotonic decreasing function of T such that r(T) → 0 as T → ∞. Contact pressure is represented by the assumption that the minimum geodesic distance between lattice points is maximized. It is shown that if (p, q), with p {$<$} q, is the contact phyllotaxis determined when contact pressure first becomes effective, then the continuation of contact pressure requires that the advance to higher phyllotaxis as r decreases must proceed via successive pairs of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence generated by the numbers p and q, namely, p, q, p + q, p + 2q, 2p + 3q, …. The divergence, starting from some value determined by p and q converges to an ideal angle , where is the golden section. A necessary and sufficient condition for the ideal angle to be is that the p and q of the initial contact phyllotaxis be consecutive Fibonacci numbers of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …. It is proved that a sufficient condition for convergence to the ideal angle −2 of normal phyllotaxis is that contact pressure begin before T = 5 or before with d initially between and .},

We provide a detailed study of this diagram.},

  abstract = {Although the Lucas sequences were known to earlier investigators such as Lagrange, Legendre and Genocchi, it is because of the enormous number and variety of results involving them, revealed by Édouard Lucas between 1876 and 1880, that they are now named after him. Since Lucas’ early work, much more has been discovered concerning these remarkable mathematical objects, and the objective of this book is to provide a much more thorough discussion of them than is available in existing monographs. In order to do this a large variety of results, currently scattered throughout the literature, are brought together. Various sections are devoted to the intrinsic arithmetic properties of these sequences, primality testing, the Lucasnomials, some associated density problems and Lucas’ problem of finding a suitable generalization of them. Furthermore, their application, not only to primality testing, but also to integer factoring, efficient solution of quadratic and cubic congruences, cryptography and Diophantine equations are briefly discussed. Also, many historical remarks are sprinkled throughout the book, and a biography of Lucas is included as an appendix.Much of the book is not intended to be overly detailed. Rather, the objective is to provide a good, elementary and clear explanation of the subject matter without too much ancillary material. Most chapters, with the exception of the second and the fourth, will address a particular theme, provide enough information for the reader to get a feel for the subject and supply references to more comprehensive results. Most of this work should be accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of elementary number theory and abstract algebra. The book’s intended audience is number theorists, both professional and amateur, students and enthusiasts.},

The palette of action of these forces ranges from mechanical pressures on organ primordia at the microscopic level up to the twisting of a peduncle that promotes resupination of a flower at the macroscopic level. Here, we argue that without these forces acting during the ontogenetic process, the actual flower phenotype would not be achieved as it is. In this review, we concentrate on mechanical forces that occur at the microscopic level and determine the fate of the flower shape by the physical constraints on meristems at an early stage of development. We thus highlight the generative role of mechanical forces over the floral phenotype and underline our general view of flower development as the sum of interactions of known physiological and genetic processes, together with physical aspects and mechanical events that are entangled towards the shaping of the mature flower.},

Composite interval mapping revealed the presence of 78 QTL affecting the 18 quantitative traits of interest, with 2–10 QTL per trait. Each QTL explained 3.0–68.0\% of the phenotypic variance, although only 4 (corresponding to 3 of 18 traits) had effects \&gt;25\%. Overall, 51 of the 78 QTL produced phenotypic effects in the expected direction, and for 13 of 18 traits the majority of QTL had the expected effect. Despite being distributed across 15 of the 17 linkage groups, there was a substantial amount of clustering among QTL controlling different traits. In several cases, regions influencing multiple traits harbored QTL with antagonistic effects, producing a cultivar-like phenotype for some traits and a wild-like phenotype for others. On the basis of the directionality of QTL, strong directional selection for increased achene size appears to have played a central role in sunflower domestication. None of the other traits show similar evidence of selection. The occurrence of numerous wild alleles with cultivar-like effects, combined with the lack of major QTL, suggests that sunflower was readily domesticated.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims The process of vascular development in plants results in the formation of a specific array of bundles that run throughout the plant in a characteristic spatial arrangement. Although much is known about the genes involved in the specification of procambium, phloem and xylem, the dynamic processes and interactions that define the development of the radial arrangement of such tissues remain elusive. Methods This study presents a spatially explicit reaction–diffusion model defining a set of logical and functional rules to simulate the differentiation of procambium, phloem and xylem and their spatial patterns, starting from a homogeneous group of undifferentiated cells. Key Results Simulation results showed that the model is capable of reproducing most vascular patterns observed in plants, from primitive and simple structures made up of a single strand of vascular bundles (protostele), to more complex and evolved structures, with separated vascular bundles arranged in an ordered pattern within the plant section (e.g. eustele). Conclusions The results presented demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that a common genetic–molecular machinery can be the basis of different spatial patterns of plant vascular development. Moreover, the model has the potential to become a useful tool to test different hypotheses of genetic and molecular interactions involved in the specification of vascular tissues.},

  abstract = {In a majority of species, leaf development is thought to proceed in a bilaterally symmetric fashion without systematic asymmetries. This is despite the left and right sides of an initiating primordium occupying niches that differ in their distance from sinks and sources of auxin. Here, we revisit an existing model of auxin transport sufficient to recreate spiral phyllotactic patterns and find previously overlooked asymmetries between auxin distribution and the centers of leaf primordia. We show that it is the direction of the phyllotactic spiral that determines the side of the leaf these asymmetries fall on. We empirically confirm the presence of an asymmetric auxin response using a DR5 reporter and observe morphological asymmetries in young leaf primordia. Notably, these morphological asymmetries persist in mature leaves, and we observe left-right asymmetries in the superficially bilaterally symmetric leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana that are consistent with modeled predictions. We further demonstrate that auxin application to a single side of a leaf primordium is sufficient to recapitulate the asymmetries we observe. Our results provide a framework to study a previously overlooked developmental axis and provide insights into the developmental constraints imposed upon leaf morphology by auxin-dependent phyllotactic patterning.},

  abstract = {La phyllotaxie d' Helianthus annuus L. montre de facon constante une disposition initiale opposée décussée faisant place plus ou moins vite à une disposition alterne, ou plus rarement à une disposition verticillée par trois. Phyllotaxy of Helianthus annuus L. shows a consistent manner opposite decussate original provision making up more or less quickly to a provision alternates , or more rarely a provision by three whorled. Phyllotaxy Helianthus annuus L. constant shows how opposite decussate original provision giving way or slower alternates with a provision or a provision rarely whorled by three more. All plants Helianthus annuus L. lost sooner or later before flowering the opposed arrangement decussate which is their original. When the arrangement is opposite decussate, the operation of almost all of the initial ring determines each whorl to the presence of very large leaf segments, being joined at their edges occupy entirely the periphery of the rod (Fig. 1) . The first disturbance on said opposite decussate arrangement consists of a separation of the two formations of a same leaf whorl. It thus sends a intersegment (space between two leaf segments on the surface of the rod).The leaves of the whorl are not opposed, although qu'insérées the same level; on one side they are joined to each other are separated by the inter-segment (Fig. 2). They say they are bijuguées. This happens sometimes from the second whorl above the cotyledons (20 cases studied), sometimes from the third whorl (43\%), sometimes from the fourth whorl (25\%), and rarely from the fifth ( 8 cases observed in 200 plants). Two or three successive whorls frequently have such a provision (see fig. 2 and 3). The inter-segment present on these whorls draw on the shank a helical area which shows the existence and the direction of winding of leaf propellers. The facts described above are general for the lot studied, but occur earlier or later before flowering. Sometimes it happens that the intersegment is visible on only one whorl in this case one has no indication of the direction of winding foliar helices. When the inter-segment is visible on these whorls, it is of increasing width and often may reach half the width of a leaf segment. It rarely exceeds this size. Then there is a further leaf formation produced by the region of the initial ring corresponding to the intersegment last whorl (Fig. 5). This training is the first production of a new generator and third center. The three leaf propellers are often offset to this level and the direction of winding may be reversed (fig. 4). The three centers rarely operate synchronously to provide three leaf whorls (Fig. 6), most often the leaves of three helices appear alone, the provision alternate, and there is usually more intersegment. When the width of the intersegment does not change, we do not observe additional training. The two helices are placed side by side, but the shift in the space corresponding to the intersegment, adds a time lag and the sheets are fed individually on the shaft (Fig. 7). Increasing the number of leaf propellers can continue using the same procedure and result in the operation of four generators centers this occurs just before flowering (Fig. 8). Conclusions: The rotation of the growing intersegment the position clearly indicates the winding direction of the two propellers of the leaf base. A third center generator works only when the inter-segment has reached a width greater than or equal to half the width of a segment of the leaf whorl.When the area of the initial ring, matching the growing inter-segment reaches a sufficient size, it gives often out of step with the normal whorls, foliar training, first production of a new generator center.

  abstract = {Complex biological patterns are often governed by simple mathematical rules. A favourite botanical example is the apparent relationship between phyllotaxis (i.e. the arrangements of leaf homologues such as foliage leaves and floral organs on shoot axes) and the intriguing Fibonacci number sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 . . .). It is frequently alleged that leaf primordia adopt Fibonacci-related patterns in response to a universal geometrical imperative for optimal packing that is supposedly inherent in most animate and inanimate structures. This paper reviews the fundamental properties of number sequences, and discusses the under-appreciated limitations of the Fibonacci sequence for describing phyllotactic patterns. The evidence presented here shows that phyllotactic whorls of leaf homologues are not positioned in Fibonacci patterns. Insofar as developmental transitions in spiral phyllotaxis follow discernible Fibonacci formulae, phyllotactic spirals are therefore interpreted as being arranged in genuine Fibonacci patterns. Nonetheless, a simple modelling exercise argues that the most common spiral phyllotaxes do not exhibit optimal packing. Instead, the consensus starting to emerge from different subdisciplines in the phyllotaxis literature supports the alternative perspective that phyllotactic patterns arise from local inhibitory interactions among the existing primordia already positioned at the shoot apex, as opposed to the imposition of a global imperative of optimal packing. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 150, 3–24.},

Specimens exhibiting the various possible phyllotactic modes (Fibonacci spirals, Lucas spirals, bijugate spirals etc...) were selected. The transitions from the initial decussate growth to these organizations, were characterized and shown to correspond to only a few archetypes. The possible transients from a decussate mode were then investigated in the model of self organization introduced by Douady and Couder (1996a, b, c). They are shown to exhibit the same phenomenology as the observed ones. These various transients have a very different probability of ccurrence which explains the difference of their frequency in plants. Finally the imperfections of the observed dispositions, which affect mainly the plastochron, are also investigated. The model provides an interpretation of this apparent disorder: after a transition the system optimizes the regularity of the parastichies but in doing so it disturbs the plastochron and the divergence. It is only when very large external disturbances affect the system that a real disorder is generated. In these latter cases the parastichies themselves disappear.},

  abstract = {The spatial arrangement of leaves and flowers around the stem, known as phyllotaxis, is controlled by an auxin-dependent reiterative mechanism that leads to regular spacing of the organs and thereby to remarkably precise phyllotactic patterns. The mechanism is based on the active cellular transport of the phytohormone auxin by cellular influx and efflux carriers, such as AUX1 and PIN1. Their important role in phyllotaxis is evident from mutant phenotypes, but their exact roles in space and time are difficult to address due to the strong pleiotropic phenotypes of most mutants in phyllotaxis. Models of phyllotaxis invoke the accumulation of auxin at leaf initials and removal of auxin through their developing vascular strand, the midvein. We have developed a precise microsurgical tool to ablate the midvein at high spatial and temporal resolution in order to test its function in leaf formation and phyllotaxis. Using amplified femtosecond laser pulses, we ablated the internal tissues in young leaf primordia of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) without damaging the overlying L1 and L2 layers. Our results show that ablation of the future midvein leads to a transient accumulation of auxin in the primordia and to an increase in their width. Phyllotaxis was transiently affected after midvein ablations, but readjusted after two plastochrons. These results indicate that the developing midvein is involved in the basipetal transport of auxin through young primordia, which contributes to phyllotactic spacing and stability.},

The expression of his general outfit depends on the choice of the first two outfits u0 and u1, which Fibonacci takes equal to O and 1 respectively; we thus obtain the sequence of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ... Lucas devotes a generous memoir published in Italy in 187723 to Leonard Pisa. Attention to the arithmetic properties of the Fibonacci sequence, which dates back to Fenuat, Frénide (and probably to earlier mathematicians), could have been aroused by a note by Gabriel Lamé of 1844, where his utility for the detention of a upper limit of the number of operations to be carried out in the search for the large common divisor of two whole numbers, as well as by the arithmetic works of Angelo Genocchi from 1868-1869. The original contribution of Lucas consists in underlining a remarkable arithmetic property of this sequence: any prime number p appears there as a factor of a tarnished rank detained. It is the law of appearance of prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence, which constitutes a synthesis between certain results of Fe1mat and Lagrange.24 It can be noted that the search for prime numbers within arithmetic sequences seems to be much earlier than this work. Thus Euler is interested in the presence of prime numbers within the arithmetic progression 4n + 1. Legendre believes to prove in 1785 that "there are an infinity of prime numbers included in any progression arithmetic whose first term and reason are prime to each other [.]. This proposition is quite difficult to demonstrate, however one can ensure that it is true. I am content to indicate this means of demonstration which it would be too long to detail ...

The use of parastichy numbers reduced the complexity of the study and created a proliferation of generalizations, among others the simple geometric model of lattices. Unfortunately, these simple descriptive method runs into difficulties when dealing with patterns presenting transitions or irregularities. Here, we propose several ways of addressing the imperfections of botanical reality. Using ontogenetic analysis, which follows the step-by-step genesis of the pattern, and crystallographic analysis, which reveal irregularity in its details, we show how to derive more information from a real botanical sample, in particular, about its irregularities and transitions. We present several examples, from the first explicit visualization of a normal Fibonacci parastichy number increase, to more exotic ones, including the quasi-symmetric patterns detected in simulations. We compare these observations qualitatively with the result of the disk-packing model, presenting evidence for the relevance of the model.},

Their architecture, in terms of number and arrangement (phyllotaxis) of flowers, play a central role in reproductive success and adaptation of plants, as well as yield in crops. We apply Compositae capitula, or flower heads, as our model system to study inflorescence development. The unique architecture of capitula, often composed of morphologically and functionally distinct types of flowers, is considered the key innovation for the evolutionar y success of this largest family of flowering plants. Moreover, the arrangement of individual flowers in intersecting spirals in capitula represent an iconic example of the geometric regularity found in nature. Our aim is to explore the gene regulator y networks that control patterning of the Compositae inflorescence meristems and their subsequent development. In this brief review, we summarize the recent technological developments and tools that allow us to explore and follow meristem patterning early on – already before we can see any visual changes in them. These include visualization of capitulum development by X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), live-imaging of dissected meristems on tissue culture media, and application of laser ablation to disrupt meristem organization and to follow its re-patterning. We anticipate that these methods are applicable to distinct species to promote comparative studies and understanding of developmental diversity of capitula within Compositae.},

  abstract = {Murray [née Clarke], Joan Elisabeth Lowther (1917–1996), cryptanalyst and numismatist, was born at 45 Idmiston Road, West Norwood, London, on 24 June 1917, the youngest child (there were three sons, and another daughter) of William Kemp Lowther Clarke, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Dorothy Elizabeth Fulford. She was educated at Dulwich high school and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she obtained a double first in mathematics and was a wrangler. While still an undergraduate, she was recruited by Gordon Welchman for the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park, the British code-breaking centre during the Second World War. When she joined GCCS in June 1940, she was assigned to Hut 8, which was responsible for the solution of naval Enigma ciphers. These were among the most difficult GCCS had to attack, partly because the naval Enigma machine, M3, was issued with eight rotors, compared with five for army and air force Enigma. She worked in a small inner room as a cryptanalyst with Alan Turing, Peter Twinn, and Tony Kendrick. Her initial task was to use the first British bombe (a high-speed key-finding aid invented by Alan Turing), which had entered service on 18 March 1940, against documents captured from the patrol boat Schiff 26. These enabled her and her co-workers to break about six days of April traffic over a period of three months. Clarke helped to test Banburismus, a highly ingenious procedure invented by Turing, which used Bayesian probability theory to reduce the number of M3 rotor combinations to be tested by the bombes from 336 to between 6 and 126. She became very adept at Banburismus, which she greatly enjoyed. Without it, the solving of naval Enigma would have been much slower, since bombes were in very short supply until mid-1943. Hut 8 could not make further progress until Enigma keys and indicator books were captured in February and May 1941. Its cryptanalysts therefore sometimes worked on other Enigma ciphers. When the outstandingly versatile Colonel John Tiltman recovered the plain text of signals enciphered on railway Enigma (a rewired version, codenamed Rocket by GCCS, of commercial Enigma) in July 1940, Clarke helped to recover the wiring of its rotors, and to solve Rocket traffic in early 1941. She returned to naval Enigma in March 1941, when GCCS received Enigma key lists taken from an armed trawler, Krebs. She worked on material recovered from a patrol boat, München, which, with other captures, led to the speedy breaking of the main naval Enigma key, Heimisch (known to GCCS as Dolphin) from August 1941 onwards; keys were captured for June and July. One of her important contributions accelerated the solution of naval Offizier signals, which were extremely difficult to break, since they were re-enciphered with a second set of plugboard settings (which interchanged ten pairs of letters), adding 150,000,000,000,000 further possible settings to a key. Clarke became engaged to Turing in the spring of 1941, although the engagement was kept secret, and she did not wear her ring in Hut 8. The engagement was broken off by mutual consent in the late summer because of Turing's homosexuality. She remained friends with Turing for the rest of his life. In mid-December 1942, after a blackout of almost 11 months, Hut 8 broke into the critically important four-rotor Enigma key, Triton (codenamed Shark by GCCS), which was used by the Atlantic U-boats. However, in early March GCCS had to warn the Admiralty that Shark and its vital intelligence might again be lost, possibly for months. Clarke helped to ensure that naval intelligence's worst fear was not realized. Hut 8 was forced to use extremely short extracts (sometimes of only four letters) from short ‘sighting’ signals from the U-boats to program the three-rotor bombes until four-rotor bombes entered service in June 1943. At the end of 1943 US Navy code-breakers in OP-20-G were allotted responsibility for breaking Shark, because US Navy four-rotor bombes were much more reliable and plentiful than the British model. Clarke remained in Hut 8 as a highly capable member of a small team which initially concentrated on M3 ciphers, such as Dolphin, although it continued to break some Shark keys until early 1945. After the war Clarke worked in GCHQ, as GCCS became, until her marriage in 1952. Her husband was Lieutenant-Colonel John Kenneth Ronald (Jock) Murray, a retired army officer in India, who also worked at GCHQ. They had no children. She rejoined GCHQ in 1962 and retired in 1977. After her retirement she helped Sir Harry Hinsley on appendix 30 to volume 3/2 of British Intelligence in the Second World War, which was a substantially revised assessment of the Polish, French, and British work in breaking Enigma. Murray was a gifted numismatist whose research was recognized by the award of the prestigious Sanford Saltus medal in 1987; this was for a 'magisterial paper' which established 'the sequence of the gold unicorns and heavy groats of James III and James IV [of Scotland], an extremely complex series which had caused great difficulty for previous students' (Numismatic Circular, 405). Joan Murray was unique as the only female cryptanalyst to work in Hut 8. She was also its longest-serving member. Her acute intelligence enabled her fully to hold her own with her co-workers in Hut 8, and to make a significant contribution to its work in helping the allies to win the battle of the Atlantic, among other successes. She was also known as one of the really good cryptanalysts in GCHQ. Although very shy and retiring, she was an enthusiastic and encouraging colleague, and was much liked and admired by all who worked with her at GCCS and GCHQ. She was appointed MBE in 1947. Murray died on 4 September 1996 at her home, 7 Larkfields, Headington, Oxford. She was predeceased by her husband. Sources R. E. [R. Erskine], ‘In memoriam: Joan E. L.

In case of the black pine~ it appeared that the greater the deviation of the parastichy quotient m/n from 0.618, the rarer the pattern.

  abstract = {In multicellular organisms, not all cells are created equal. Instead, organismal complexity is achieved by specialisation and division of labour between distinct cell types. Therefore, the organism depends on the presence, correct proportion and function of all cell types. It follows that early development is geared towards setting up the basic body plan and to specify cell lineages. Since plants employ a post-embryonic mode of development, the continuous growth and addition of new organs require a source of new cells, as well as a strict regulation of cellular composition throughout the entire life-cycle. To meet these demands, evolution has brought about complex regulatory systems to maintain and control continuously active stem cell systems. Here, we review recent work on the mechanisms of non cell-autonomous control of shoot stem cells in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with a strong focus on the cell-to-cell mobility and function of the WUSCHEL homeodomain transcription factor.},

The iterative generation of new aerial organs, (leaves, lateral inflorescences and flowers) at the meristem follows regular patterns, called phyllotaxis. Phyllotaxis has long been proposed to self-­‐organize from the combined action of growth and of inhibitory fields blocking organogenesis in the vicinity of existing organs in the meristem. In this review we will highlight how a combination of mathematical/computational modeling and experimental biology has demonstrated that the spatio-­‐temporal distribution of the plant hormone auxin controls both organogenesis and the establishment of inhibitory fields. We will discuss recent advances showing that auxin likely acts through a combination of biochemical and mechanical regulatory mechanisms that control not only the pattern of organogenesis in the meristem but also post-­‐meristematic growth, to shape the shoot.},

In plants, positional information provided by the hormone auxin regulates rhythmic organ production at the shoot apex, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of auxin gradients is unknown. We used quantitative imaging to demonstrate that auxin carries high-definition graded information not only in space but also in time. We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis. This provides a mechanism to temporally differentiate sites of organ initiation and exemplifies how spatio-temporal positional information can be used to create rhythmicity.},

  abstract = {Why living forms develop in a relatively robust manner, despite various sources of internal or external variability, is a fundamental question in developmental biology. Part of the answer relies on the notion of developmental constraints: at any stage of ontogenesis, morphogenetic processes are constrained to operate within the context of the current organism being built. One such universal constraint is the shape of the organism itself, which progressively channels the development of the organism toward its final shape. Here, we illustrate this notion with plants, where strikingly symmetric patterns (phyllotaxis) are formed by lateral organs. This Hypothesis article aims first to provide an accessible overview of phyllotaxis, and second to argue that the spiral patterns in plants are progressively canalized from local interactions of nascent organs. The relative uniformity of the organogenesis process across all plants then explains the prevalence of certain patterns in plants, i.e. Fibonacci phyllotaxis.},

Defining new geometric tools allowing to work with irregular patterns and local transitions, we provide simple explanations for the emergence of these two states within the same elementary model.

The pattern arises not from pre-localized pushes from below, but rather as a spontaneous physical response of the expanding surface to lateral constraint. Physical properties of a uniform formative layer (tunica) and a uniform substratum (corpus) provide the wavelength of the undulation and hence the number of organs. Establishment of the parameters for this buckling, as well as the follow-through of organ development, is biological. We propose, however, that at the moment of periodic pattern initiation the plant tissue simply manifests the spontaneous but complex properties of a two-layered inanimate sheet.},

  abstract = {Patterns of leaves or florets, phyllotaxis, have long been well characterized using parameters that describe the patterns as lattices of points or arrangements of contiguous circles. The patterns are usually interpreted in terms of spiral lines drawn through the points or circles. For example, in a pine cone the number of visible spiral lines, in two sets with opposing spiral sense, is typically a pair of adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci series. This format for characterization, while precise and terse for spiral Fibonacci patterns, has four disadvantages or limitations when applied generally. First, when the spiral notation is applied to obviously orthogonal patterns, such as decussate, it implies developmental chirality even though the pattern has no intrinsic handedness. Second, the classification has led to no convenient subgrouping, of all patterns: i.e., do all forms with one organ per node constitute a natural group? Third, the characterization is of a static pattern based on an assumed constant center of symmetry. Characterization is not related to the mode of formation of the patterns. Finally, the notation is not convenient for describing gradual developmental transitions between patterns. We find that a broad range of phyllotactic patterns can be conveniently characterized by diagrams, each derived from a single measurement of the apical surface that produces the organs. During each developmental cycle, this area expands to a maximum and then is abruptly reduced to a minimum by demarcation of a new leaf (or leaves). The center of area is generally different before and after demarcation, hence its movement during the demarcation event is a vector. We present a method for juxtaposing these vectors over consecutive plastochrons. The resulting planar figure is diagnostic of the broad categories of phyllotaxis. In “balanced” forms, whorled apices, there is no net movement of the center of area so the resulting figure is a point. In the second category, “linear”, the vectors reverse, retracing a line segment. Leaves alternating in a plane, distichous phyllotaxy, arise from this pattern. In the third category, “polygonal”, the juxtaposed vectors advance so as to circumscribe a polygon. Such plants (some Euphorbias) generate leaves in helical sequence but the leaves stand in vertical ranks. In the fourth category, “circular” the vectors circumscribe a circle. This behavior is found in plants with irrational divergence angles and hence applies to the common Fibonacci spiral forms. The vectorial mode of primary categorization appears to lack the four listed shortcomings.},

  abstract = {In vascular plants, the arrangement of organs around the stem generates geometric patterns called phyllotaxis. In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, as in the majority of species, single organs are initiated successively at a divergence angle from the previous organ close to the canonical angle of 137.5°, producing a Fibonacci spiral. Given that little is known about the robustness of these geometric arrangements, we undertook to characterize phyllotaxis by measuring divergence angles between organs along the stems of wild-type and specific mutant plants with obvious defects in phyllotaxis. Sequences of measured divergence angles exhibit segments of non-canonical angles in both genotypes, albeit to a far greater extent in the mutant. We thus designed a pipeline of methods for analyzing these perturbations. The latent structure models used in this pipeline combine a non-observable model representing perturbation patterns (either a variable-order Markov chain or a combinatorial model) with von Mises distributions representing divergence angle uncertainty. We show that the segments of non-canonical angles in both wild-type and mutant plants can be explained by permutations in the order of insertion along the stem of two or three consecutive organs. The number of successive organs between two permutations reveals specific patterns that depend on the nature of the preceding permutation (2- or 3-permutation). We also highlight significant individual deviations from 137.5° in the level of baseline segments and a marked relationship between permutation of organs and defects in the elongation of the internodes between these organs. These results demonstrate that permutations are an intrinsic property of spiral phyllotaxis and that their occurrence is genetically regulated.},

Recent advances combining insights from molecular phylogeny, palaeobotany and evo–devo research address these questions and suggest the sequence of morphological innovation during vascular plant shoot and leaf evolution. The evidence pinpoints testable developmental and genetic hypotheses relating to the origin of branching and indeterminate shoot architectures prior to the evolution of leaves, and demonstrates underestimation of polyphyly in the evolution of leaves from branching forms in ‘telome theory’ hypotheses of leaf evolution. This review discusses fossil, developmental and genetic evidence relating to the evolution of vascular plant shoots and leaves in a phylogenetic framework. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The Rhynie cherts: our earliest terrestrial ecosystem revisited’.},

Auxin patterning in the shoot apical meristem is in turn brought about by the subcellular polar distribution of the putative auxin efflux mediator, PIN1. However, the question of what signals determine PIN1 polarization and how this gives rise to regular patterns of auxin concentration remains unknown. Here we address these questions by using mathematical modeling combined with confocal imaging. We propose a model that is based on the assumption that auxin influences the polarization of its own efflux within the meristem epidermis. We show that such a model is sufficient to create regular spatial patterns of auxin concentration on systems with static and dynamic cellular connectivities, the latter governed by a mechanical model. We also optimize parameter values for the PIN1 dynamics by using a detailed auxin transport model, for which parameter values are taken from experimental estimates, together with a template consisting of cell and wall compartments as well as PIN1 concentrations quantitatively extracted from confocal data. The model shows how polarized transport can drive the formation of regular patterns.},

At later stages mechanical load is transferred to the subepidermal layer (endothecium), contributing to proper organ shape. We propose the concept of inflation potential, encapsulating mechanical and anatomical features causing differential growth.

  abstract = {Mexico has long been recognized as one of the world's cradles of domestication with evidence for squash (Cucurbita pepo) cultivation appearing as early as 8,000 cal B.C. followed by many other plants, such as maize (Zea mays), peppers (Capsicum annuum), common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). We present archaeological, linguistic, ethnographic, and ethnohistoric data demonstrating that sunflower (Helianthus annuus) had entered the repertoire of Mexican domesticates by ca. 2600 cal B.C., that its cultivation was widespread in Mexico and extended as far south as El Salvador by the first millennium B.C., that it was well known to the Aztecs, and that it is still in use by traditional Mesoamerican cultures today. The sunflower's association with indigenous solar religion and warfare in Mexico may have led to its suppression after the Spanish Conquest. The discovery of ancient sunflower in Mexico refines our knowledge of domesticated Mesoamerican plants and adds complexity to our understanding of cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {In plants and parenchymatous brown algae the body arises through the activity of an apical meristem (a niche of cells or a single cell). The meristem produces lateral organs in specific patterns, referred to as phyllotaxis. In plants, two different control mechanisms have been proposed: one is position-dependent and relies on morphogen accumulation at future organ sites; the other is a lineage-based system which links phyllotaxis to the apical cell division pattern. Here we examine the apical patterning of the brown alga, Sargassum muticum, which exhibits spiral phyllotaxis (137.5° angle) and an unlinked apical cell division pattern. The Sargassum apex presents characteristics of a self-organising system, similar to plant meristems. In contrast to complex plant meristems, we were unable to correlate the plant morphogen auxin with bud positioning in Sargassum, nor could we predict cell wall softening at new bud sites. Our data suggests that in Sargassum muticum there is no connection between phyllotaxis and the apical cell division pattern indicating a position-dependent patterning mechanism may be in place. The underlying mechanisms behind the phyllotactic patterning appear to be distinct from those seen in plants.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Organ morphogenesis is the process of shape acquisition initiated with a small reservoir of undifferentiated cells. In plants, morphogenesis is a complex endeavor that comprises a large number of interacting elements, including mechanical stimuli, biochemical signaling, and genetic prerequisites. Because of the large body of data being produced by modern laboratories, solving this complexity requires the application of computational techniques and analyses. In the last two decades, computational models combined with wet-lab experiments have advanced our understanding of plant organ morphogenesis. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the most important achievements in the field of computational plant morphodynamics. We present a brief history from the earliest attempts to describe plant forms using algorithmic pattern generation to the evolution of quantitative cell-based models fueled by increasing computational power. We then provide an overview of the most common types of “digital plant” paradigms, and demonstrate how models benefit from diverse techniques used to describe cell growth mechanics. Finally, we highlight the development of computational frameworks designed to resolve organ shape complexity through integration of mechanical, biochemical, and genetic cues into a quantitative standardized and user-friendly environment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

I have considered an inhibitory spacing mechanism at some length, as it is a plausible candidate. However, the same treatment would apply equally well to depletion of, or competition for, a compound by developing leaves, and could no doubt accommodate other ingredients.The mathematical principles involved are clear when it is assumed that only two leaves (the contacts) position a new leaf. There is some experimental evidence for this assumption. Nonetheless, it is not a precondition for Fibonacci phyllotaxis, since a computer model shows that this pattern is generated even when many leaves contribute to inhibition at a given point. Indeed, the Fibonacci pattern seems to be a robust and stable mathematical phenomenon, a finding which goes some way to explaining its widespread occurrence throughout the plant kingdom.},

The front is generated primarily by a PIN1 mediated instability of a uniform auxin concentration and leaves in its wake an auxin fluctuation field at whose maxima new primordia are assumed to be initiated. Because it propagates through a slowly changing metric, the patterns have to make transitions between spirals enumerated by decreasing parastichy numbers. The point configurations of maxima coincide almost exactly with those configurations generated by the use of discrete algorithms based on optimal packing ideas which suggests that pushed pattern forming fronts may be a general mechanism by which natural organisms can follow optimal strategies.},

As plants grow, these fractions often transition according to simple rules related to Fibonacci sequences. This mathematical regularity originates from leaf primordia at the shoot tip (shoot apical meristem), which successively arise at fixed intervals of a divergence angle, typically the golden angle of 137.5°. Algebraic and numerical interpretations have been proposed to explain the golden angle observed in phyllotaxis. However, it remains unknown whether phyllotaxis has adaptive value, even though two centuries have passed since the phenomenon was discovered. Here, I propose a new adaptive mechanism explaining the presence of the golden angle. This angle is the optimal solution to minimize the energy cost of phyllotaxis transition. This model accounts for not only the high precision of the golden angle but also the occurrences of other angles observed in nature. The model also effectively explains the observed diversity of rational and irrational numbers in phyllotaxis.},

  abstract = {The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants explores mathematical models of developmental processes and structures of plants, and illustrates them using state-of-the-art computer-generated images. Plant models which grow, interact with the environment, produce flowers and fruits, and finally die, have an immense intuitive appeal of "bringing life into a computer." In front of a graphics monitor it is easy to forget the underlying mathematical formulae and simply look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors, even mutating. Without compromising the mathematical rigor of presentation the authors have tried to preserve this "touch of magic" accompanying in their research. The following areas receive particular attention: methods for the modeling and rendering of plants which are suitable for realistic image synthesis; the scientific potential of computer graphics in the visualization of biological structures and processes; the relationship between control mechanisms employed by li- ing plants and the resulting complex developmental sequences and structures; and the relationship between developmental processes, self-similarity and fractals. The formalism of L-systems are adopted as the primary mathematical vehicle used to express developmental processes. The notion of L-systems was conceived in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer as a formal model of plant development. Its exceptional elegance was promptly recognized by mathematicians, who soon developed a comprehensive theory of L-systems. However, only recently has computer graphics revealed the full potential of L-systems applied to plant modeling. Although the focus is on the original results of joint research led by the authors, a survey of alternative methods for plant modeling is also included.},

The models can be descriptive, directly recapitulating observations and measurements of plants; mechanistic, explaining higher-level processes in terms of lower-level ones; or they may combine features of both classes. We present the basic idea of L-systems, motivate and outline some of their most useful extensions, and give a taste of current techniques for modeling with L-systems. The sample models progress in the scale of organization from a bacterium to a herbaceous plant to a tree, and simulate different forms of information transfer during the development, from communication between adjacent cells to bidirectional information exchange with the environment.},

Here we investigate phyllotactic patterns in fasciated flower heads in the Asteraceae plant family. We begin by surveying the phenomenon of fasciation. We then show that phyllotactic patterns in fasciated heads can be generated by removing the inessential assumption of circularity from the previously published model of gerbera heads. To characterize these patterns, we revisit the conceptual framework in which phyllotactic patterns are commonly described. We note that some notions, in particular parastichies and parastichy numbers, maintain their significance in non-circular phyllotaxis, whereas others, in particular the divergence angle, need to be extended or lose their role. These observations highlight a number of open problems related to phyllotaxis in general, which may be elucidated by studies of fasciated heads.},

Spiral patterns characterized by Fibonacci numbers have attracted the particular interest of natural scientists and mathematicians. Numerous reviews have dealt with the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying phyllotaxis, and modeling studies have sought to recreate phyllotaxis according to mathematical, biochemical, or physical laws. However, what is the functional significance of regular plant architecture, and how did it evolve? We discuss the developmental constraints and selective forces that may have favored the selection of phyllotaxis, and we argue that a central driver of regular phyllotaxis may have been limitations in the allocation of founder cells and metabolic resources to the different tissues in the shoot apex.},

Leaves and flowers are formed from the shoot apical meristem, triggered by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported through plant tissues by specific cellular influx and efflux carrier proteins. Here we show that proteins involved in auxin transport regulate phyllotaxis. Our data indicate that auxin is transported upwards into the meristem through the epidermis and the outermost meristem cell layer. Existing leaf primordia act as sinks, redistributing auxin and creating its heterogeneous distribution in the meristem. Auxin accumulation occurs only at certain minimal distances from existing primordia, defining the position of future primordia. This model for phyllotaxis accounts for its reiterative nature, as well as its regularity and stability.},

  abstract = {Current methods of classifying the phyllotaxis patterns found at stem apices are discussed, and it is concluded that the numerical measures employed do not characterize solely the arrangement or positioning of the primordia, but are partially determined also by primordial shape. A method of phyllotaxis assessment is proposed that is free from this ambiguity. For a complete description three parameters are necessary, namely, the angle of the cone tangential to the apex in the region under consideration, the divergence angle, and the plastochrone ratio, i.e. the ratio of the radial distances of two successive primordia from the central axis. For assessment of the transverse component of the system the two last parameters are alone required. Of these three characteristics the plastochrone ratio is the most useful, and from it a 'phyllotaxis index' may be calculated that immediately conveys the most essential information relating to the primordial arrangement. Since this index is a continuously varying function, phyllotaxis assessment is no longer confined to a few discrete recognized systems, and it becomes possible to compare quantitatively with one another phyllotaxis arrangements of very diverse kinds. The relationship between the index and primordial pattern is presented for all important divergence angles, and also for those systems wherein more than one leaf appears at each node. The phyllotaxis index is rigidly related to the ratio of the transverse components of two areas, that of the central apex and that of the newly initiated primordium; a simple extension enables a similar relationship to be determined on the actual apical surface, opening the way for a practical adaptation of the older theoretical concept of 'bulk ratio'.},

In plants, the control circuits that underlie division and differentiation within meristems have been well studied, but those that underlie feedback on meristems from lateral organs remain largely unknown. Here we show that long-distance auxin transport mediates this feedback in a non-cell-autonomous manner. A low-auxin zone is associated with the shoot apical meristem (SAM) organization center, and auxin levels negatively affect SAM size. Using computational model simulations, we show that auxin transport from lateral organs can inhibit auxin transport from the SAM through an auxin transport switch and thus maintain SAM auxin homeostasis and SAM size. Genetic and microsurgical analyses confirmed the model's predictions. In addition, the model explains temporary change in SAM size of \mkbibemph{yabby} mutants. Our study suggests that the canalization-based auxin flux can be widely adapted as a feedback control mechanism in plants.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

(2003) Nature 426, 255–260], provides an intuitively plausible interpretation of the data, but raises questions of whether the proposed mechanism is, in fact, capable of producing the observed temporal and spatial patterns, is robust, can start de novo, and can account for phyllotactic transitions, such as the frequently observed transition from decussate to spiral phyllotaxis. To answer these questions, we created a computer simulation model based on data described previously or in this paper and reasonable hypotheses. The model reproduces, within the standard error, the divergence angles measured in Arabidopsis seedlings and the effects of selected experimental manipulations. It also reproduces distichous, decussate, and tricussate patterns. The model thus offers a plausible link between molecular mechanisms of morphogenesis and the geometry of phyllotaxis.},

  abstract = {Phyllotactic patterns are some of the most conspicuous in nature. To create these patterns plants must control the divergence angle between the appearance of successive organs, sometimes to within a fraction of a degree. The most common angle is the Fibonacci or golden angle, and its prevalence has led to the hypothesis that it has been selected by evolution as optimal for plants with respect to some fitness benefits, such as light capture. We explore arguments for and against this idea with computer models. We have used both idealized and scanned leaves from Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta to measure the overlapping leaf area of simulated plants after varying parameters such as leaf shape, incident light angles, and other leaf traits. We find that other angles generated by Fibonacci-like series found in nature are equally optimal for light capture, and therefore should be under similar evolutionary pressure. Our findings suggest that the iterative mechanism for organ positioning itself is a more likely target for evolutionary pressure, rather than a specific divergence angle, and our model demonstrates that the heteroblastic progression of leaf shape in A. thaliana can provide a potential fitness benefit via light capture.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a model of plant organ placement motivated by the appearance of large Fibonacci numbers in phyllotaxis, and provides the first large-scale empirical validation of this model. Specifically it evaluates the ability of Schwendener disk-stacking models to generate parastichy patterns seen in a large dataset of sunflower seedheads. We find that features of this data that the models can account for include a predominance of Fibonacci counts, usually in a pair of left and right counts on a single seedhead, a smaller but detectable frequency of Lucas and double Fibonacci numbers, a comparable frequency of Fibonacci numbers plus or minus one, and occurrences of pairs of roughly equal but non-Fibonacci counts in a `columnar' structure. A further observation in the dataset was an occasional lack of rotational symmetry in the parastichy spirals, and this paper demonstrates those in the model for the first time. Schwendener disk-stacking models allow Fibonacci structure by ensuring that a parameter of the model corresponding to the speed of plant growth is kept small enough. While many other models can exhibit Fibonacci structure, usually by specifying a rotation parameter to an extremely high precision, no other model has accounted for further, non-Fibonacci, features in the observed data. The Schwendener model produces these naturally in the region of parameter space just beyond where the Fibonacci structure breaks down, without any further parameter fitting. We also introduce stochasticity into the model and show that it while it can be responsible for the appearance of columnar structure, the disordered dynamics of the deterministic system near the critical region can also generate this structure.},

Among other things, he claimed at one point to be able to explain the phenomenon of “Fibonacci phyllotaxis”: the appearance of Fibonacci numbers in the structures of plants. He never published this work, but did leave a nearly complete manuscript on morphogenesis and lattice phyllotaxis, together with more fragmentary notes on Fibonacci phyllotaxis. I discuss evidence that he developed a number of key ideas close to modern thinking, and tantalising hints that he came very close to a mathematical explanation of how the “daisy grows” into these patterns.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

Considering the ubiquity of the Fibonacci numbers in nature, embracing many species of flora, we expect a very simple geometrical law to be responsible. Success in finding such a law does not constitute a proof, but it is at the least an indication that we should look here with mathematical rather than biological eyes. The idea may seem self-evident. However, in the literature it has not yet been honored as the basis for constructing the phyllotaxis in centric, planar models. It is shown here that for the construction of a phyllotactic structure, no special angles or distances need be defined; natural growth functions can be used; planar, cylindrical, conical, and paraboloid constructions are possible within the same model; and constructions leading to accessory sequences and multijugate sequences can also be carried out.},

The model assumes that the expansion and curving of the receptacle surface is just sufficient to accommodate the development of the florets, thus minimizing the quantity of plant tissue involved. The model assumes a fixed angular separation (divergence) between successive florets, an S-shaped (sigmoidal) growth function followed by each florets, and a fixed time delay (period) between the initiation of successive florets. It is further assumes that the shape and relative position occupied by the florets on the receptacle surface are invariant in time. By this theory, the shape of the receptacle surface is fully determined once the mathematical form of the growth function is specified. Using the logistic growth function, the theory is tested against the measured shapes of plant receptacles from different taxa at various points in their development.

  abstract = {Plant leaves are arranged around the stem in a beautiful geometry that is called phyllotaxis. In the majority of plants, phyllotaxis exhibits a distichous, Fibonacci spiral, decussate, or tricussate pattern. To explain the regularity and limited variety of phyllotactic patterns, many theoretical models have been proposed, mostly based on the notion that a repulsive interaction between leaf primordia determines the position of primordium initiation. Among them, particularly notable are the two models of Douady and Couder (alternate-specific form, DC1; more generalized form, DC2), the key assumptions of which are that each leaf primordium emits a constant power that inhibits new primordium formation and that this inhibitory effect decreases with distance. It was previously demonstrated by computer simulations that any major type of phyllotaxis can occur as a self-organizing stable pattern in the framework of DC models. However, several phyllotactic types remain unaddressed. An interesting example is orixate phyllotaxis, which has a tetrastichous alternate pattern with periodic repetition of a sequence of different divergence angles: 180°, 90°, −180°, and −90°. Although the term orixate phyllotaxis was derived from Orixa japonica, this type is observed in several distant taxa, suggesting that it may reflect some aspects of a common mechanism of phyllotactic patterning. Here we examined DC models regarding the ability to produce orixate phyllotaxis and found that model expansion via the introduction of primordial age-dependent changes of the inhibitory power is absolutely necessary for the establishment of orixate phyllotaxis. The orixate patterns generated by the expanded version of DC2 (EDC2) were shown to share morphological details with real orixate phyllotaxis. Furthermore, the simulation results obtained using EDC2 fitted better the natural distribution of phyllotactic patterns than did those obtained using the previous models. Our findings imply that changing the inhibitory power is generally an important component of the phyllotactic patterning mechanism.},

  abstract = {Phyllotaxis, the distribution of organs such as leaves and flowers on their support, is a key attribute of plant architecture. The geometric regularity of phyllotaxis has attracted multidisciplinary interest for centuries, resulting in an understanding of the patterns in the model plants Arabidopsis and tomato down to the molecular level. Nevertheless, the iconic example of phyllotaxis, the arrangement of individual florets into spirals in the heads of the daisy family of plants (Asteraceae), has not been fully explained. We integrate experimental data and computational models to explain phyllotaxis in Gerbera hybrida. We show that phyllotactic patterning in gerbera is governed by changes in the size of the morphogenetically active zone coordinated with the growth of the head. The dynamics of these changes divides the patterning process into three phases: the development of an approximately circular pattern with a Fibonacci number of primordia near the head rim, its gradual transition to a zigzag pattern, and the development of a spiral pattern that fills the head on the template of this zigzag pattern. Fibonacci spiral numbers arise due to the intercalary insertion and lateral displacement of incipient primordia in the first phase. Our results demonstrate the essential role of the growth and active zone dynamics in the patterning of flower heads.},

  abstract = {The Asteraceae plant family is characterized by inflorescences, called flower heads or capitula that may combine hundreds of individual florets into a single flower-like structure. The florets are arranged in a regular phyllotactic pattern with Fibonacci numbers of left- and right-winding spirals. Such a pattern may be disrupted due to physical constraints or by wounding occurring during the early meristem development. Recovery from wounding re-establishes patterning although the mechanisms have remained elusive. In this study, we applied Gerbera hybrida as a model system and established methods to conduct wounding experiments either with syringe needles or using laser ablation combined with live imaging of head meristems. By revisiting the historical experiments in sunflower, we conducted wounding to transgenic auxin reporter lines of gerbera and followed the recovery of cellular growth and meristem patterning. We show that wounding disrupted the expression of the gerbera CLAVATA3 (GhCLV3) gene that marks the undifferentiated meristematic region and led to de novo re-initiation of patterning at the wound margin. During the recovery growth, three to five layers of elongated cells showing periclinal cell division planes and lacking auxin signal were formed at the wound rim. DR5 auxin signal was shown to localize and form regularly spaced maxima in a distance from the wound rim. Consequently, spiral pattern of contact parastichies was re-established by stacking of new auxin maxima on top of the previous ones. The developed methods facilitate future studies on understanding the molecular mechanisms of de novo patterning of meristems.},
