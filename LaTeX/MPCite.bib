  abstract = {To determine the consequences of contact pressure in phyllotaxis, a mathematical model is constructed in which a leaf distribution is represented by a point lattice of n + 1 lattice points at equal intervals on a helix wound around a cylinder. The model is normalized by taking the girth of the cylinder as 1 and by measuring time T in plastochrones, so that n = [T]. r stands for the normalized internode distance (component of the distance between two consecutive lattice points that is parallel to the axis of the cylinder). d stands for the divergence (fraction of a turn between consecutive lattice points). It is assumed that r is a monotonic decreasing function of T such that r(T) \textrightarrow{} 0 as T \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}. Contact pressure is represented by the assumption that the minimum geodesic distance between lattice points is maximized. It is shown that if (p, q), with p {$<$} q, is the contact phyllotaxis determined when contact pressure first becomes effective, then the continuation of contact pressure requires that the advance to higher phyllotaxis as r decreases must proceed via successive pairs of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence generated by the numbers p and q, namely, p, q, p + q, p + 2q, 2p + 3q, \ldots. The divergence, starting from some value determined by p and q converges to an ideal angle , where is the golden section. A necessary and sufficient condition for the ideal angle to be is that the p and q of the initial contact phyllotaxis be consecutive Fibonacci numbers of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots. It is proved that a sufficient condition for convergence to the ideal angle -2 of normal phyllotaxis is that contact pressure begin before T = 5 or before with d initially between and .},

Each QTL explained 3.0\textendash 68.0\% of the phenotypic variance, although only 4 (corresponding to 3 of 18 traits) had effects \&gt;25\%. Overall, 51 of the 78 QTL produced phenotypic effects in the expected direction, and for 13 of 18 traits the majority of QTL had the expected effect. Despite being distributed across 15 of the 17 linkage groups, there was a substantial amount of clustering among QTL controlling different traits. In several cases, regions influencing multiple traits harbored QTL with antagonistic effects, producing a cultivar-like phenotype for some traits and a wild-like phenotype for others. On the basis of the directionality of QTL, strong directional selection for increased achene size appears to have played a central role in sunflower domestication. None of the other traits show similar evidence of selection. The occurrence of numerous wild alleles with cultivar-like effects, combined with the lack of major QTL, suggests that sunflower was readily domesticated.},

Although much is known about the genes involved in the specification of procambium, phloem and xylem, the dynamic processes and interactions that define the development of the radial arrangement of such tissues remain elusive. Methods This study presents a spatially explicit reaction\textendash diffusion model defining a set of logical and functional rules to simulate the differentiation of procambium, phloem and xylem and their spatial patterns, starting from a homogeneous group of undifferentiated cells. Key Results Simulation results showed that the model is capable of reproducing most vascular patterns observed in plants, from primitive and simple structures made up of a single strand of vascular bundles (protostele), to more complex and evolved structures, with separated vascular bundles arranged in an ordered pattern within the plant section (e.g. eustele). Conclusions The results presented demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that a common genetic\textendash molecular machinery can be the basis of different spatial patterns of plant vascular development. Moreover, the model has the potential to become a useful tool to test different hypotheses of genetic and molecular interactions involved in the specification of vascular tissues.},

  abstract = {Complex biological patterns are often governed by simple mathematical rules. A favourite botanical example is the apparent relationship between phyllotaxis (i.e. the arrangements of leaf homologues such as foliage leaves and floral organs on shoot axes) and the intriguing Fibonacci number sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 . . .). It is frequently alleged that leaf primordia adopt Fibonacci-related patterns in response to a universal geometrical imperative for optimal packing that is supposedly inherent in most animate and inanimate structures. This paper reviews the fundamental properties of number sequences, and discusses the under-appreciated limitations of the Fibonacci sequence for describing phyllotactic patterns. The evidence presented here shows that phyllotactic whorls of leaf homologues are not positioned in Fibonacci patterns. Insofar as developmental transitions in spiral phyllotaxis follow discernible Fibonacci formulae, phyllotactic spirals are therefore interpreted as being arranged in genuine Fibonacci patterns. Nonetheless, a simple modelling exercise argues that the most common spiral phyllotaxes do not exhibit optimal packing. Instead, the consensus starting to emerge from different subdisciplines in the phyllotaxis literature supports the alternative perspective that phyllotactic patterns arise from local inhibitory interactions among the existing primordia already positioned at the shoot apex, as opposed to the imposition of a global imperative of optimal packing. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 150, 3\textendash 24.},

Specimens exhibiting the various possible phyllotactic modes (Fibonacci spirals, Lucas spirals, bijugate spirals etc...) were selected. The transitions from the initial decussate growth to these organizations, were characterized and shown to correspond to only a few archetypes. The possible transients from a decussate mode were then investigated in the model of self organization introduced by Douady and Couder (1996a, b, c). They are shown to exhibit the same phenomenology as the observed ones. These various transients have a very different probability of ccurrence which explains the difference of their frequency in plants. Finally the imperfections of the observed dispositions, which affect mainly the plastochron, are also investigated. The model provides an interpretation of this apparent disorder: after a transition the system optimizes the regularity of the parastichies but in doing so it disturbs the plastochron and the divergence. It is only when very large external disturbances affect the system that a real disorder is generated. In these latter cases the parastichies themselves disappear.},

  abstract = {The spatial arrangement of leaves and flowers around the stem, known as phyllotaxis, is controlled by an auxin-dependent reiterative mechanism that leads to regular spacing of the organs and thereby to remarkably precise phyllotactic patterns. The mechanism is based on the active cellular transport of the phytohormone auxin by cellular influx and efflux carriers, such as AUX1 and PIN1. Their important role in phyllotaxis is evident from mutant phenotypes, but their exact roles in space and time are difficult to address due to the strong pleiotropic phenotypes of most mutants in phyllotaxis. Models of phyllotaxis invoke the accumulation of auxin at leaf initials and removal of auxin through their developing vascular strand, the midvein. We have developed a precise microsurgical tool to ablate the midvein at high spatial and temporal resolution in order to test its function in leaf formation and phyllotaxis. Using amplified femtosecond laser pulses, we ablated the internal tissues in young leaf primordia of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) without damaging the overlying L1 and L2 layers. Our results show that ablation of the future midvein leads to a transient accumulation of auxin in the primordia and to an increase in their width. Phyllotaxis was transiently affected after midvein ablations, but readjusted after two plastochrons. These results indicate that the developing midvein is involved in the basipetal transport of auxin through young primordia, which contributes to phyllotactic spacing and stability.},

  abstract = {Historically, the study of phyllotaxis was greatly helped by the simple description of botanical patterns by only two integer numbers, namely the number of helices (parastichies) in each direction tiling the plant stem. The use of parastichy numbers reduced the complexity of the study and created a proliferation of generalizations, among others the simple geometric model of lattices. Unfortunately, these simple descriptive method runs into difficulties when dealing with patterns presenting transitions or irregularities. Here, we propose several ways of addressing the imperfections of botanical reality. Using ontogenetic analysis, which follows the step-by-step genesis of the pattern, and crystallographic analysis, which reveal irregularity in its details, we show how to derive more information from a real botanical sample, in particular, about its irregularities and transitions. We present several examples, from the first explicit visualization of a normal Fibonacci parastichy number increase, to more exotic ones, including the quasi-symmetric patterns detected in simulations. We compare these observations qualitatively with the result of the disk-packing model, presenting evidence for the relevance of the model.},

  abstract = {Murray [n\'ee Clarke], Joan Elisabeth Lowther (1917\textendash 1996), cryptanalyst and numismatist, was born at 45 Idmiston Road, West Norwood, London, on 24 June 1917, the youngest child (there were three sons, and another daughter) of William Kemp Lowther Clarke, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Dorothy Elizabeth Fulford. She was educated at Dulwich high school and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she obtained a double first in mathematics and was a wrangler. While still an undergraduate, she was recruited by Gordon Welchman for the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park, the British code-breaking centre during the Second World War. When she joined GCCS in June 1940, she was assigned to Hut 8, which was responsible for the solution of naval Enigma ciphers. These were among the most difficult GCCS had to attack, partly because the naval Enigma machine, M3, was issued with eight rotors, compared with five for army and air force Enigma. She worked in a small inner room as a cryptanalyst with Alan Turing, Peter Twinn, and Tony Kendrick. Her initial task was to use the first British bombe (a high-speed key-finding aid invented by Alan Turing), which had entered service on 18 March 1940, against documents captured from the patrol boat Schiff 26. These enabled her and her co-workers to break about six days of April traffic over a period of three months. Clarke helped to test Banburismus, a highly ingenious procedure invented by Turing, which used Bayesian probability theory to reduce the number of M3 rotor combinations to be tested by the bombes from 336 to between 6 and 126. She became very adept at Banburismus, which she greatly enjoyed. Without it, the solving of naval Enigma would have been much slower, since bombes were in very short supply until mid-1943. Hut 8 could not make further progress until Enigma keys and indicator books were captured in February and May 1941. Its cryptanalysts therefore sometimes worked on other Enigma ciphers. When the outstandingly versatile Colonel John Tiltman recovered the plain text of signals enciphered on railway Enigma (a rewired version, codenamed Rocket by GCCS, of commercial Enigma) in July 1940, Clarke helped to recover the wiring of its rotors, and to solve Rocket traffic in early 1941. She returned to naval Enigma in March 1941, when GCCS received Enigma key lists taken from an armed trawler, Krebs. She worked on material recovered from a patrol boat, M\"unchen, which, with other captures, led to the speedy breaking of the main naval Enigma key, Heimisch (known to GCCS as Dolphin) from August 1941 onwards; keys were captured for June and July. One of her important contributions accelerated the solution of naval Offizier signals, which were extremely difficult to break, since they were re-enciphered with a second set of plugboard settings (which interchanged ten pairs of letters), adding 150,000,000,000,000 further possible settings to a key. Clarke became engaged to Turing in the spring of 1941, although the engagement was kept secret, and she did not wear her ring in Hut 8. The engagement was broken off by mutual consent in the late summer because of Turing's homosexuality. She remained friends with Turing for the rest of his life. In mid-December 1942, after a blackout of almost 11 months, Hut 8 broke into the critically important four-rotor Enigma key, Triton (codenamed Shark by GCCS), which was used by the Atlantic U-boats. However, in early March GCCS had to warn the Admiralty that Shark and its vital intelligence might again be lost, possibly for months. Clarke helped to ensure that naval intelligence's worst fear was not realized. Hut 8 was forced to use extremely short extracts (sometimes of only four letters) from short `sighting' signals from the U-boats to program the three-rotor bombes until four-rotor bombes entered service in June 1943. At the end of 1943 US Navy code-breakers in OP-20-G were allotted responsibility for breaking Shark, because US Navy four-rotor bombes were much more reliable and plentiful than the British model. Clarke remained in Hut 8 as a highly capable member of a small team which initially concentrated on M3 ciphers, such as Dolphin, although it continued to break some Shark keys until early 1945. After the war Clarke worked in GCHQ, as GCCS became, until her marriage in 1952. Her husband was Lieutenant-Colonel John Kenneth Ronald (Jock) Murray, a retired army officer in India, who also worked at GCHQ. They had no children. She rejoined GCHQ in 1962 and retired in 1977. After her retirement she helped Sir Harry Hinsley on appendix 30 to volume 3/2 of British Intelligence in the Second World War, which was a substantially revised assessment of the Polish, French, and British work in breaking Enigma. Murray was a gifted numismatist whose research was recognized by the award of the prestigious Sanford Saltus medal in 1987; this was for a 'magisterial paper' which established 'the sequence of the gold unicorns and heavy groats of James III and James IV [of Scotland], an extremely complex series which had caused great difficulty for previous students' (Numismatic Circular, 405). Joan Murray was unique as the only female cryptanalyst to work in Hut 8. She was also its longest-serving member. Her acute intelligence enabled her fully to hold her own with her co-workers in Hut 8, and to make a significant contribution to its work in helping the allies to win the battle of the Atlantic, among other successes. She was also known as one of the really good cryptanalysts in GCHQ. Although very shy and retiring, she was an enthusiastic and encouraging colleague, and was much liked and admired by all who worked with her at GCCS and GCHQ. She was appointed MBE in 1947. Murray died on 4 September 1996 at her home, 7 Larkfields, Headington, Oxford. She was predeceased by her husband. Sources R. E. [R. Erskine], `In memoriam: Joan E. L.

Therefore, the organism depends on the presence, correct proportion and function of all cell types. It follows that early development is geared towards setting up the basic body plan and to specify cell lineages. Since plants employ a post-embryonic mode of development, the continuous growth and addition of new organs require a source of new cells, as well as a strict regulation of cellular composition throughout the entire life-cycle. To meet these demands, evolution has brought about complex regulatory systems to maintain and control continuously active stem cell systems. Here, we review recent work on the mechanisms of non cell-autonomous control of shoot stem cells in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with a strong focus on the cell-to-cell mobility and function of the WUSCHEL homeodomain transcription factor.},

In this review we will highlight how a combination of mathematical/computational modeling and experimental biology has demonstrated that the spatio-\--temporal distribution of the plant hormone auxin controls both organogenesis and the establishment of inhibitory fields.

We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis.

Part of the answer relies on the notion of developmental constraints: at any stage of ontogenesis, morphogenetic processes are constrained to operate within the context of the current organism being built. One such universal constraint is the shape of the organism itself, which progressively channels the development of the organism toward its final shape. Here, we illustrate this notion with plants, where strikingly symmetric patterns (phyllotaxis) are formed by lateral organs. This Hypothesis article aims first to provide an accessible overview of phyllotaxis, and second to argue that the spiral patterns in plants are progressively canalized from local interactions of nascent organs. The relative uniformity of the organogenesis process across all plants then explains the prevalence of certain patterns in plants, i.e. Fibonacci phyllotaxis.},

Using the disk-accretion model, first introduced by Schwendener and justified by modern biological studies, we observe two distinct types of solutions: the classical Fibonacci-like ones, and also more irregular configurations exhibiting nearly equal number of helices in a quasi-square packing, the quasi-symmetric ones, which are a generalization of the whorled patterns. Defining new geometric tools allowing to work with irregular patterns and local transitions, we provide simple explanations for the emergence of these two states within the same elementary model. A companion paper will provide a wide array of plant data analyses that support our view.},

  abstract = {The patterns seen in plant shoots and flowers, `phyllotaxis', originate in an annular region. They are typically propagated inward from this ring-like area. We show here that an initial undulating periodic pattern (a `whorl' of hump-like organs) can arise in a flat unstructured annulus. The pattern arises not from pre-localized pushes from below, but rather as a spontaneous physical response of the expanding surface to lateral constraint. Physical properties of a uniform formative layer (tunica) and a uniform substratum (corpus) provide the wavelength of the undulation and hence the number of organs. Establishment of the parameters for this buckling, as well as the follow-through of organ development, is biological. We propose, however, that at the moment of periodic pattern initiation the plant tissue simply manifests the spontaneous but complex properties of a two-layered inanimate sheet.},

  abstract = {Patterns of leaves or florets, phyllotaxis, have long been well characterized using parameters that describe the patterns as lattices of points or arrangements of contiguous circles. The patterns are usually interpreted in terms of spiral lines drawn through the points or circles. For example, in a pine cone the number of visible spiral lines, in two sets with opposing spiral sense, is typically a pair of adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci series. This format for characterization, while precise and terse for spiral Fibonacci patterns, has four disadvantages or limitations when applied generally. First, when the spiral notation is applied to obviously orthogonal patterns, such as decussate, it implies developmental chirality even though the pattern has no intrinsic handedness. Second, the classification has led to no convenient subgrouping, of all patterns: i.e., do all forms with one organ per node constitute a natural group? Third, the characterization is of a static pattern based on an assumed constant center of symmetry. Characterization is not related to the mode of formation of the patterns. Finally, the notation is not convenient for describing gradual developmental transitions between patterns. We find that a broad range of phyllotactic patterns can be conveniently characterized by diagrams, each derived from a single measurement of the apical surface that produces the organs. During each developmental cycle, this area expands to a maximum and then is abruptly reduced to a minimum by demarcation of a new leaf (or leaves). The center of area is generally different before and after demarcation, hence its movement during the demarcation event is a vector. We present a method for juxtaposing these vectors over consecutive plastochrons. The resulting planar figure is diagnostic of the broad categories of phyllotaxis. In ``balanced'' forms, whorled apices, there is no net movement of the center of area so the resulting figure is a point. In the second category, ``linear'', the vectors reverse, retracing a line segment. Leaves alternating in a plane, distichous phyllotaxy, arise from this pattern. In the third category, ``polygonal'', the juxtaposed vectors advance so as to circumscribe a polygon. Such plants (some Euphorbias) generate leaves in helical sequence but the leaves stand in vertical ranks. In the fourth category, ``circular'' the vectors circumscribe a circle. This behavior is found in plants with irrational divergence angles and hence applies to the common Fibonacci spiral forms. The vectorial mode of primary categorization appears to lack the four listed shortcomings.},

Recent advances combining insights from molecular phylogeny, palaeobotany and evo\textendash devo research address these questions and suggest the sequence of morphological innovation during vascular plant shoot and leaf evolution. The evidence pinpoints testable developmental and genetic hypotheses relating to the origin of branching and indeterminate shoot architectures prior to the evolution of leaves, and demonstrates underestimation of polyphyly in the evolution of leaves from branching forms in `telome theory' hypotheses of leaf evolution. This review discusses fossil, developmental and genetic evidence relating to the evolution of vascular plant shoots and leaves in a phylogenetic framework.

Auxin patterning in the shoot apical meristem is in turn brought about by the subcellular polar distribution of the putative auxin efflux mediator, PIN1. However, the question of what signals determine PIN1 polarization and how this gives rise to regular patterns of auxin concentration remains unknown. Here we address these questions by using mathematical modeling combined with confocal imaging. We propose a model that is based on the assumption that auxin influences the polarization of its own efflux within the meristem epidermis. We show that such a model is sufficient to create regular spatial patterns of auxin concentration on systems with static and dynamic cellular connectivities, the latter governed by a mechanical model. We also optimize parameter values for the PIN1 dynamics by using a detailed auxin transport model, for which parameter values are taken from experimental estimates, together with a template consisting of cell and wall compartments as well as PIN1 concentrations quantitatively extracted from confocal data. The model shows how polarized transport can drive the formation of regular patterns.},

I have considered an inhibitory spacing mechanism at some length, as it is a plausible candidate. However, the same treatment would apply equally well to depletion of, or competition for, a compound by developing leaves, and could no doubt accommodate other ingredients.The mathematical principles involved are clear when it is assumed that only two leaves (the contacts) position a new leaf. There is some experimental evidence for this assumption. Nonetheless, it is not a precondition for Fibonacci phyllotaxis, since a computer model shows that this pattern is generated even when many leaves contribute to inhibition at a given point. Indeed, the Fibonacci pattern seems to be a robust and stable mathematical phenomenon, a finding which goes some way to explaining its widespread occurrence throughout the plant kingdom.},

The front is generated primarily by a PIN1 mediated instability of a uniform auxin concentration and leaves in its wake an auxin fluctuation field at whose maxima new primordia are assumed to be initiated. Because it propagates through a slowly changing metric, the patterns have to make transitions between spirals enumerated by decreasing parastichy numbers. The point configurations of maxima coincide almost exactly with those configurations generated by the use of discrete algorithms based on optimal packing ideas which suggests that pushed pattern forming fronts may be a general mechanism by which natural organisms can follow optimal strategies.},

  abstract = {Plant leaves are arranged around a stem axis in a regular pattern characterized by common fractions, a phenomenon known as phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy. As plants grow, these fractions often transition according to simple rules related to Fibonacci sequences. This mathematical regularity originates from leaf primordia at the shoot tip (shoot apical meristem), which successively arise at fixed intervals of a divergence angle, typically the golden angle of 137.5\textdegree. Algebraic and numerical interpretations have been proposed to explain the golden angle observed in phyllotaxis. However, it remains unknown whether phyllotaxis has adaptive value, even though two centuries have passed since the phenomenon was discovered. Here, I propose a new adaptive mechanism explaining the presence of the golden angle. This angle is the optimal solution to minimize the energy cost of phyllotaxis transition. This model accounts for not only the high precision of the golden angle but also the occurrences of other angles observed in nature. The model also effectively explains the observed diversity of rational and irrational numbers in phyllotaxis.},

However, what is the functional significance of regular plant architecture, and how did it evolve? We discuss the developmental constraints and selective forces that may have favored the selection of phyllotaxis, and we argue that a central driver of regular phyllotaxis may have been limitations in the allocation of founder cells and metabolic resources to the different tissues in the shoot apex.},

Leaves and flowers are formed from the shoot apical meristem, triggered by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported through plant tissues by specific cellular influx and efflux carrier proteins. Here we show that proteins involved in auxin transport regulate phyllotaxis. Our data indicate that auxin is transported upwards into the meristem through the epidermis and the outermost meristem cell layer. Existing leaf primordia act as sinks, redistributing auxin and creating its heterogeneous distribution in the meristem. Auxin accumulation occurs only at certain minimal distances from existing primordia, defining the position of future primordia. This model for phyllotaxis accounts for its reiterative nature, as well as its regularity and stability.},

A method of phyllotaxis assessment is proposed that is free from this ambiguity. For a complete description three parameters are necessary, namely, the angle of the cone tangential to the apex in the region under consideration, the divergence angle, and the plastochrone ratio, i.e. the ratio of the radial distances of two successive primordia from the central axis. For assessment of the transverse component of the system the two last parameters are alone required. Of these three characteristics the plastochrone ratio is the most useful, and from it a 'phyllotaxis index' may be calculated that immediately conveys the most essential information relating to the primordial arrangement. Since this index is a continuously varying function, phyllotaxis assessment is no longer confined to a few discrete recognized systems, and it becomes possible to compare quantitatively with one another phyllotaxis arrangements of very diverse kinds. The relationship between the index and primordial pattern is presented for all important divergence angles, and also for those systems wherein more than one leaf appears at each node. The phyllotaxis index is rigidly related to the ratio of the transverse components of two areas, that of the central apex and that of the newly initiated primordium; a simple extension enables a similar relationship to be determined on the actual apical surface, opening the way for a practical adaptation of the older theoretical concept of 'bulk ratio'.},

In plants, the control circuits that underlie division and differentiation within meristems have been well studied, but those that underlie feedback on meristems from lateral organs remain largely unknown. Here we show that long-distance auxin transport mediates this feedback in a non-cell-autonomous manner. A low-auxin zone is associated with the shoot apical meristem (SAM) organization center, and auxin levels negatively affect SAM size. Using computational model simulations, we show that auxin transport from lateral organs can inhibit auxin transport from the SAM through an auxin transport switch and thus maintain SAM auxin homeostasis and SAM size. Genetic and microsurgical analyses confirmed the model's predictions. In addition, the model explains temporary change in SAM size of \emph{yabby} mutants. Our study suggests that the canalization-based auxin flux can be widely adapted as a feedback control mechanism in plants.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Recent molecular-genetic experiments indicate that active transport of the plant hormone auxin is the key process regulating phyllotaxis. A conceptual model based on these experiments, introduced by Reinhardt et al. [Reinhardt, D., Pesce, E. R., Stieger, P., Mandel, T., Baltensperger, K., et al. (2003) Nature 426, 255\textendash 260], provides an intuitively plausible interpretation of the data, but raises questions of whether the proposed mechanism is, in fact, capable of producing the observed temporal and spatial patterns, is robust, can start de novo, and can account for phyllotactic transitions, such as the frequently observed transition from decussate to spiral phyllotaxis. To answer these questions, we created a computer simulation model based on data described previously or in this paper and reasonable hypotheses. The model reproduces, within the standard error, the divergence angles measured in Arabidopsis seedlings and the effects of selected experimental manipulations. It also reproduces distichous, decussate, and tricussate patterns. The model thus offers a plausible link between molecular mechanisms of morphogenesis and the geometry of phyllotaxis.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},
