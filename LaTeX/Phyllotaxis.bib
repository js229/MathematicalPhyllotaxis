  abstract = {To determine the consequences of contact pressure in phyllotaxis, a mathematical model is constructed in which a leaf distribution is represented by a point lattice of n + 1 lattice points at equal intervals on a helix wound around a cylinder. The model is normalized by taking the girth of the cylinder as 1 and by measuring time T in plastochrones, so that n = [T]. r stands for the normalized internode distance (component of the distance between two consecutive lattice points that is parallel to the axis of the cylinder). d stands for the divergence (fraction of a turn between consecutive lattice points). It is assumed that r is a monotonic decreasing function of T such that r(T) → 0 as T → ∞. Contact pressure is represented by the assumption that the minimum geodesic distance between lattice points is maximized. It is shown that if (p, q), with p {$<$} q, is the contact phyllotaxis determined when contact pressure first becomes effective, then the continuation of contact pressure requires that the advance to higher phyllotaxis as r decreases must proceed via successive pairs of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence generated by the numbers p and q, namely, p, q, p + q, p + 2q, 2p + 3q, …. The divergence, starting from some value determined by p and q converges to an ideal angle , where is the golden section. A necessary and sufficient condition for the ideal angle to be is that the p and q of the initial contact phyllotaxis be consecutive Fibonacci numbers of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …. It is proved that a sufficient condition for convergence to the ideal angle −2 of normal phyllotaxis is that contact pressure begin before T = 5 or before with d initially between and .},

  abstract = {Past failures to solve the riddle of phyllotaxis were due in part to faulty methods employed in the construction of theories or the assembling of observational data. The following examples of faulty methods are analysed to reveal hidden errors or unwanted consequences: 1) Tait argued that if the numbers of conspicuous left and right spirals are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, then the divergence angle must be between one-third and one-half of a turn. He then concluded that the converse was necessarily true. 2) Schwendener used a force diagram to show that equal and opposite forces were acting at the ends of a line segment AA' in the plane development of a cylindrical surface. He then concluded that the points A and A' were compelled to move apart. 3) Davies and others measured divergence angles on many plants with a given phyllotaxis, and then plotted a frequency distribution of the measured values to show that they cluster about an average value. 4) Richards and others worked exclusively with difficult transcendental equations derived from a disc model of phyllotaxis, although a simple transformation would have converted the transcendental equations into simple algebraic equations. 5) Some investigators overlook the fact that the girth of the stem is a natural unit of lenght for the study of phyllotaxis. Using other units tends to obscure an important functional relationship that is revealed when the natural unit is used. The analysis of these faulty methods is followed by a discussion of a) the importance of using a phase-space diagram and b) how a mathematical model should be understood.},

The contributors explore the portrayal of mathematical activity and mathematicians as well as their ideas and instruments, how artists displayed their mathematical skills and the choices visual artists made between geometry and arithmetic, as well as Euclid’s impact on drawing, artistic practice and theory. These chapters cover a broad geographical area that includes Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, France and England. The artists, philosophers and mathematicians whose work is discussed include Leon Battista Alberti, Nicholas Cusanus, Marsilio Ficino, Francesco di Giorgio, Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Verrocchio, as well as Michelangelo, Galileo, Piero della Francesca, Girard Desargues, William Hogarth, Albrecht Dürer, Luca Pacioli and Raphael.},

  abstract = {Plant hormone auxin has critical roles in plant growth, dependent on its heterogeneous distribution in plant tissues. Exactly how auxin transport and developmental processes such as growth coordinate to achieve the precise patterns of auxin observed experimentally is not well understood. Here we use mathematical modelling to examine the interplay between auxin dynamics and growth and their contribution to formation of patterns in auxin distribution in plant tissues. Mathematical models describing the auxin-related signalling pathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant tissues are derived. A key assumption of our models is the regulation of PIN proteins by the auxin-responsive ARF-Aux/IAA signalling pathway, with upregulation of PIN biosynthesis by ARFs. Models are analysed and solved numerically to examine the long-time behaviour and auxin distribution. Changes in auxin-related signalling processes are shown to be able to trigger transition between passage- and spot-type patterns in auxin distribution. The model was also shown to be able to generate isolated cells with oscillatory dynamics in levels of components of the auxin signalling pathway which could explain oscillations in levels of ARF targets that have been observed experimentally. Cell growth was shown to have influence on PIN polarisation and determination of auxin distribution patterns. Numerical simulation results indicate that auxin-related signalling processes can explain the different patterns in auxin distributions observed in plant tissues, whereas the interplay between auxin transport and growth can explain the ‘reverse-fountain’ pattern in auxin distribution observed at plant root tips.},

  abstract = {Note 579 of On Growth and Form: This celebrated series, which appears in the continued fraction  (1\,⁄\,1)\,+\,(1\,⁄\,(1\,+\,)) etc. and is closely connected with the Sectio aurea or Golden Mean, is commonly called the Fibonacci series, after a very learned twelfth century arithmetician (known also as Leonardo of Pisa), who has some claims to be considered the introducer of Arabic numerals into christian Europe. It is called Lami’s series by some, after Father Bernard Lami, a contemporary of Newton’s, and one of the co-discoverers of the parallelogram of forces. It was well-known to Kepler, who, in his paper De nive sexangula (cf. supra, p. 480), discussed it in connection with the form of the dodecahedron and icosahedron, and with the ternary or quinary symmetry of the flower. (Cf. Ludwig, F., Kepler über das Vorkommen der Fibonaccireihe im Pflanzenreich, Bot. Centralbl. LXVIII, p. 7, 1896). Professor William Allman, Professor of Botany in Dublin (father of the historian of Greek geometry), speculating on the same facts, put forward the curious suggestion that the cellular tissue of the dicotyledons, or exogens, would be found to consist of dodecahedra. and that of the monocotyledons or endogens of icosahedra (On the math­e­mat­i­cal connexion between the parts of Vegetables: abstract of a Memoir read before the Royal Society in the year 1811 (privately printed, n.d.). Cf. De Candolle, Organogénie végétale, I, p. 534). ODNB: Allman published two (now negligible) books on the classification of plants (Analysis per differentias constantes viginti, inchoata, generum plantarum …, 1828; and Familiae plantarum, 1836) and some minor papers on mathematics and botanical topics. His Abstract of a memoir on the mathematical connexion between the parts of vegetables … read before the Royal Society was privately printed (1844) because his essay, 'An attempt to illustrate a mathematical connection between the parts of vegetables', dated 31 January 1811 and communicated by Robert Brown to the Royal Society of London, remained unpublished; manuscript copies survive in the Royal Society and in the Natural History Museum, London.},

  abstract = {During the development of a plant from seed, spore or other relatively small reproductive body, progressive changes usually occur, so that the adult stages are more or less markedly different from the first-formed juvenile stages. The early botanists described many such examples of plants with characteristic juvenile stages, but the first experimental studies of this aspect of development were due to Goebel (1889, 1896a, 1898, 1913, 1928) who made a distinction between heteroblastic development, in which the differences between juvenile and adult phases are quite well-marked, and homoblastic development in which the differences are relatively slight. Goebel recognized that there is no sharp separation between these two types of development, which are connected, in fact, by the condition characteristic of the majority of plants, in which the change from the juvenile to the adult condition is a gradual one. Although originally applied to the development of plants with a fairly abrupt change from the juvenile to the adult state, the term heteroblastic is now usually extended to cover the more frequent course of development in which the differences between the two phases are gradually established. Diels (1906), for instance, considered that the occurrence of juvenile and adult stages is only one aspect of the broader phenomenon of helicomorphy in which organs of a particular structure (helicomorphs) are associated with a definite age or level of development.},

This involved a series of group Drawing Labs, one-to-one sessions, and discussions between the authors. The drawings generated during the collaboration were then reviewed by four experts in cell division. We propose that such an approach has value, both in communicating the dynamic nature of biological processes and in generating new insights and hypotheses that can be tested by artists and scientists.},

Net entropy flow into the leaf is negative. On the assumption that the entropy in the leaf is in a steady state, the entropy production in the typical deciduous leaf in moderate conditions [the solar energy absorbed by both sides of the leaf is E solar =0.0602 (J cm −2 s −1 )] becomes S prod =1.810 −4 (J cm −2 s −1 K −1 ). The positiveness of the entropy production shows that the Second Law of Thermodynamics certainly holds in the plant leaf. Entropy productions in other conditions are also calculated. The entropy production in the leaf S prod becomes a linear function of the solar energy absorbed by the leaf E solar : S prod ≈-(29.5 E solar )10 −4 . A theorem is presented: the entropy production in plant leaves oscillates during the period of one day, paralleling the daily solar energy absorbed by leaves.},

  abstract = {There are good reasons why the importance of developmental biology for an understanding of evolution had to be rediscovered recently (Gould, 1977; Løvtrup, 1981; Bonner, 1982). The Synthetic Theory of Evolution had been built up on the demonstration that natural populations contain an immense amount of genetic variation that could fully account for the morphological variation studied by naturalists (Mayr and Provine, 1980). This central achievement of the Synthetic Theory had to be defended against a false picture of genetic evolution due to rare mutations with major, often deleterious effects. The creative force in evolution undoubtedly is not mutation pressure, but selection. To support this statement, the store of genetic variation in natural populations had to be characterized, and it had to be shown that steady selection pressure could slowly and gradually alter characters by accumulating small additive effects of many genes.},

  abstract = {Questia The greatest Latin mathematician of the Middle Ages was Leonardo Fibonacci (1170–1230), sometimes known as Leonardo Pisanus or Leonardo of Pisa. He made his mark in 1202 when he published his Book on the Abacus, in which he explored the possibilities of decimal-based mathematics. He developed a sequence of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence that was to have important implications. It goes like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987 … In the sequence, each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. Fibonacci developed the algebraic formula to express this sequence; it is called a recursion relation. The significance of the formula, for our purposes at least, is that it describes a surprising number of natural phenomena. The formula, when mapped on a graph, corresponds exactly with the spiral arrangement of petals on flowers, the curve of snail shells, the twisting array of branches around the trunk of a tree. The ratio of pine leaves on opposed spirals of a pine cone is always 5: 8; of bumps on a mature pineapple 8:13; of seeds in the center of a sunflower 21: 34—all of which are adjacent Fibonacci pairs. The number of rabbits produced in a litter under ideal conditions is always a Fibonacci number. Moreover, once one progresses several places into the sequence, the ratio between the adjacent numbers of the sequence becomes constant and approaches a quantity that the ancient Greeks called the Golden Mean: 1.618.10 Many other correspondences exist—and so Fibonacci's discovery did much to affirm the medieval certainty that they lived in a rationally ordered world. His formula was later used by Renaissance artists and architects to design the curves and ratios they used to create what they regarded as perfect balance and proportion. (10) This is getting a bit esoteric. To the Greeks the Golden Mean was an ideal ratio to create visual beauty. Imagine a line segment AB. At some point along that line there is a point X. The ideal proportion is reached when AX is to XB as XB is to AB, which is a ratio of 1.618 (10). This Golden Mean was used throughout Greek architecture (it governs the proportions of the Parthenon, for example) and sculpture (the Venus de Milo).},

This paper, offering a transdisciplinary survey of approaches using his epigenetic landscape images, argues that (i) Waddington’s legacy is much broader than is usually recognized—it is widespread across the life sciences (e.g. stem cell biology, developmental psychology and cultural anthropology). In addition, I will show that (ii) there exist as yet unrecognized heuristic roles, especially in model building and theory formation, which Waddington’s images play within his work. These different methodological facets envisioned by Waddington are used as a natural framework to analyze and classify the manners of usage of epigenetic landscape images in post-Waddingtonian ‘landscape approaches’. This evaluation of Waddington’s pictorial legacy reveals that there are highly diverse lines of traditions in the life sciences, which are deeply rooted in Waddington’s methodological work.},

During the development of the inflorescence, two morphogenetic periods can be distinguished (i) before and (ii) during and after the development of floral parts. In the first period, when the floral primordia appear, the phyllotactic system could be explained by global processes at the inflorescence level. In the second period, the development of floral parts produces patterns which can be explained by local processes at the floral level. In this analysis the author defines the concepts of open system and closed system in phyllotaxis. In a closed system (e.g. spadix) the elements are arranged on a continuous and closed surface. In an open system (e.g. shoot apex) the elements appear on a surface periodically renewed and are removed from each other by the intercalary growth.},

One way to take into account the perturbed patterns is to use a probabilistic approach to phyllotaxis. This review will focus mainly on recent probabilistic approaches that can be used to analyse perturbed patterns found in the plant kingdom in general and in phyllotactic mutants in particular. More precisely, it will be shown how probabilistic approaches can be used to determine the degree of order of phyllotactic patterns.

  abstract = {In 1952 Turing published a paper which showed how under restricted conditions a class of chemical reactions could give biological patterns in diffusion-coupled cells. Although this theory has been much discussed, little has been learnt about the range and type of pattern it can generate. In order to do this and to see how stable the patterns are, we have examined the system in detail and written a computer program to simulate Turing's kinetics for two morphogens over various assemblies of cells. We find that on one-dimensional lines of cells, patterns can indeed be produced and that the chemical wavelengths follow all of Turing's predictions. The results show that stable repeating peaks of chemical concentration of periodicity 2–20 cells can be obtained in embryos in periods of time of less than an hour. We do find however that these patterns are not reliable: small variations in initial conditions give small but significant changes in the number and positions of observed peaks. Similar results are observed in two-dimensional assemblies of cells. On rectangles, random blotches are observed whose position cannot be reliably predicted. On cylinders whose circumference is less than the chemical wavelength, annular stripes are produced. For larger cylinders, blotches that lie very approximately on helices are generated; again sharp prediction of the detailed pattern is impossible. The significance of these results for the developing embryo is discussed. We conclude that Turing kinetics, at least in the simple cases that we have studied, are too unreliable to serve as the generating mechanism for features such as digits which are characterized by a consistent number of units. The theory is however more than adequate by these criteria to specify less well-defined developing patterns such as those of hair follicles or leaf organization. It is emphasized however that the Turing theory is quite unable to generate regulative systems, only mosaicpatterns can be produced.},

  abstract = {BARLOW, P. W., 1989. Meristems, metamers and modules in the development of shoot and root systems. Root and shoot systems are hierarchical organizations whose levels are represented, in part, by cells and meristems. Meristems produce modules which in turn construct the architectural model. The latter is species specific and its structure depends on the geometrical interrelationships between the modular elements. The place of the metamer within this hierarchical scheme is discussed. Metamers derive directly from meristem activity and are externally recognizable as reiterated sub-units of the module. Another sub-unit of module construction, the cellular complex, or merophyte, is also a product of meristem activity, but, in contrast to the metamer, it is an internal, rather than an external, anatomical feature. Being cellular, it increases the ‘span’ of the cell level rather than constituting a level in its own right. Although the physical boundaries of metamer and merophyte can overlap, or even coincide, the two units belong to different conceptual schemes of module structure: the metamer is defined from a ‘classical’ morphological viewpoint, whereas the merophyte derives from a cellular conception of plant structure. Both the merophyte and the metamer have a role in clarifying the understanding of plant development since both provide insights into the functioning of the meristems from which they are derived and the structure of the module to which they contribute. For example, modules which lack an obvious metameric construction can usefully be analysed in terms of their merophytic organization. This is particularly true of roots of lower plants. Here, the merophytes reflect the presence and activity of a specialized meristematic apical cell. On the other hand, modules of higher plants, which lack such apical cells, also lack clearly defined merophytes, but their shoots have obvious metamers which reflect the activity of the meristem as a whole. It should be possible to represent the development of modules from cells, via their intermediate sub-structures of meristems and metamers, by means of formal languages of automata theory. One of these, a graphical algorithm (Petri net), is applied in this developmental context.},

Various aspects of primordium initiation, positioning, and emergence were quantified with a view to discovering variable and constant features of these processes. Variable parameters were the rate and frequency of root primordium emergence. Constant parameters, at least under the prevailing conditions, were the spacing between successive laterals and primordia, and the position of the primordia in relation to the vascular system. A model of primordium initiation is presented which combines controls determined by the divisional history of the potential primordium cell and by the vascular pattern.},

  abstract = {Morphogenesis occurs in 3D space over time and is guided by coordinated gene expression programs. Here we use postembryonic development in Arabidopsis plants to investigate the genetic control of growth. We demonstrate that gene expression driving the production of the growth-stimulating hormone gibberellic acid and downstream growth factors is first induced within the radicle tip of the embryo. The center of cell expansion is, however, spatially displaced from the center of gene expression. Because the rapidly growing cells have very different geometry from that of those at the tip, we hypothesized that mechanical factors may contribute to this growth displacement. To this end we developed 3D finite-element method models of growing custom-designed digital embryos at cellular resolution. We used this framework to conceptualize how cell size, shape, and topology influence tissue growth and to explore the interplay of geometrical and genetic inputs into growth distribution. Our simulations showed that mechanical constraints are sufficient to explain the disconnect between the experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and early postembryonic growth. The center of cell expansion is the position where genetic and mechanical facilitators of growth converge. We have thus uncovered a mechanism whereby 3D cellular geometry helps direct where genetically specified growth takes place.},

The primordia can be assigned positions along a basic phyllotactic spiral with a divergence angle of about 137.5°. In addition, there are regular deviations from a spiral arrangement. Typically, the first 26 primordia in phyllotactic sequence are arranged in two concentric circles of 13 primordia with considerable deviations in the divergence angle and in the distances between primordia along a parastichy at positions 13 and 26. This arrangement can be simulated by geometric models that include nearest neighbor packing, together with spiral phyllotaxis. The circular arrangement of peripheral primordia at nearly equal radial distances from the center of the developing capitulum helps to explain the numerical constancy (canalization) of peripheral structures, especially the constant number of 13 inner phyllaries on heads with very different numbers of florets.},

They differ, among other characters, in the numbers of florets and inner and outer phyllaries (involucral bracts) per head. Higher numbers in A92 are mainly the consequence of smaller primordia while the capitulum buds in both strains are about equal in size. Disruptive selection from a large F2 of the hybrid between A92 and C96 has produced lines with transgressive numbers of parts with non-parental correlations among numbers of parts. The early development of the capitula was studied in F4 families derived from two F2 plants selected for extreme organ number phenotypes. Differences in organ numbers among these families are primarily due to differences in capitulum size which did not differ significantly between the parental strains. Values for other parameters such as floret primordium size, height of the zone in which inner phyllaries arise, and difference in size between peripheral and central florets, did not significantly contribute to the observed differences in organ numbers. The multiple gene differences suggested by the transgressive segregation in the F2 can be partly traced back to various primary effects on meristem differentiation.},

  abstract = {Perhaps the most extraordianry aspect of the pineapples physical makeup lies in its mathematical proporitons. It forms one of the most perfect examples in nature of the phenomenon know as the Divine Proportion. In the ancient world great importance was attached to this concept, which was known as the Golden Mean: it affected the layout of buildings, the composition of art and even literary structure. The basus is a constant called phi (1.61.80339). Discovered by the Greek mathematician Euclid, phi emerges from a geometrical theorem that generates a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the twopreceding numbers 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 and so on. it was later named the Fibonacci series in honour of the great thirteenth-century Italian thinker Leonardo Fibonacci (also known as Leonardo of Pisa). (ref 5) p4  In the 1820s it was discovered that, aazingly, the Fibonacci series frequently occurs in nature, illustrated particulalry clearly in the pineapple (as well as a snail's shell or a sunflower's florets, amongst other examples). The eys on its shell are arranged in curving rows: one set goes one way from base to top, the other croesses the first row at an oblique angle The number of rows of each always, but awlays, confrms to two consecutive numberd from the Fibonacci series: usually 5 \& 8 or 8 \& 13 , depending on the variety. Every single fruit is the same in this respect. In practical terms, thisminiises the amount of mechanical stress exerted on it dueing growth. (ref 6). But it also means that it fulfils the properties of Divine Proportion - it is, mathematically perfect. p 27  yet it was the appearance of the pineapple that most impressed those new to it. The irony is that while Nature has designed it this in order to pretect it from casual predators, it had not bargained with the peculiar demands of Man. According to the love-struck Oviedo, When a man looks upon the beauty of this fruit he enjoys seeing its composition, the adornment with whih nature painted it and made it so pleasant to the sight... It is the most beautiful of any of the fruits Ihave seen. [] Nature works with elaborate care []  I have found equal care in the composition and beauty of this fruit more than all I have seen beyond comparirson. I do not suppse there is in the whole world any other of so exquisite and lovely.appearance.   p44 the way to tell it is a pineapple is to look for a crown of spikes coming out the top or a rosette of leave around the bottom  Beauman ['it is no conventional beauty' It is possible that it is here hat the Divine Proportions [] of the pineapple come into play. for centuries, philosophers have considered beauty to be all about proportion: to Aristotle it was to be found in 'order and symmetry and definiteness'; while St Augustine was convinced that the scret lay in geometric form and balance.},

  abstract = {Tubular crystals, two-dimensional lattices wrapped into cylindrical topologies, arise in many contexts, including botany and biofilaments, and in physical systems such as carbon nanotubes. The geometrical principles of botanical phyllotaxis, describing the spiral packings on cylinders commonly found in nature, have found application in all these systems. Several recent studies have examined defects in tubular crystals associated with crystalline packings that must accommodate a fixed tube radius. Here we study the mechanics of tubular crystals with variable tube radius, with dislocations interposed between regions of different phyllotactic packings. Unbinding and separation of dislocation pairs with equal and opposite Burgers vectors allow the growth of one phyllotactic domain at the expense of another. In particular, glide separation of dislocations offers a low-energy mode for plastic deformations of solid tubes in response to external stresses, reconfiguring the lattice step by step. Through theory and simulation, we examine how the tube's radius and helicity affects, and is in turn altered by, the mechanics of dislocation glide. We also discuss how a sufficiently strong bending rigidity can alter or arrest the deformations of tubes with small radii.},

These phyllotactic patterns are generated by a constant divergence angle between successive buds (or whorls thereof) that first appears at the shoot apircal meristem and is maintained across later ontogentic stages when it can be observed at the macroscopic scale. Do the branches along a tree trunk exhibit similar patterns? Here we use branch skeleton data derived from terrestrial laser scans to empirically estimate the distributions of the divergence angles between successive branches along the trunks of mature European beech, Norway spruce, and Scots pine trees. We find that rather than clustering around a particular value, species-specific branch divergence angles feature statistical properties characteristic of a uniform distribution. We hypothesise this to be the result of the stochasticity in bud development and branch shedding, and provide a rigorous mathematical proof that even when the divergence angle between successive lateral buds is constant, the observed distribution of branch divergence angles will approximate a uniform distribution if bud mortality and branch shedding rates are high.},

In particular, we focus on the morphogenetic differences between simple and complex leaves and how carnivorous plants form three-dimensional insect traps. We discuss how evolution has shaped leaf diversity in the case of complex leaves, by tinkering with organ-wide growth and local growth repression, and in carnivorous plants, by modifying the relative growth of the lower and upper sides of the leaf primordium to create insect-digesting traps.},

However, it has also been proposed that asymmetric auxin levels within initiating leaves help establish leaf polarity, based in part on observations of the DII auxin sensor. By analyzing and quantifying the expression of the R2D2 auxin sensor, we find that there is no obvious asymmetry in auxin levels during Arabidopsis leaf development. We further show that the mDII control sensor also exhibits an asymmetry in expression in developing leaf primordia early on, while it becomes more symmetric at a later developmental stage as reported previously. Together with other recent findings, our results argue against the importance of auxin asymmetry in establishing leaf polarity.},

Citizen science projects have been remarkably successful in advancing scientific knowledge, and contributions from citizen scientists now provide a vast quantity of data about species occurrence and distribution around the world. Most citizen science projects also strive to help participants learn about the organisms they are observing and to experience the process by which scientific investigations are conducted. Developing and implementing public data-collection projects that yield both scientific and educational outcomes requires significant effort. This article describes the model for building and operating citizen science projects that has evolved at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology over the past two decades. We hope that our model will inform the fields of biodiversity monitoring, biological research, and science education while providing a window into the culture of citizen science.}

  abstract = {The link between genetic regulation and the definition of form and size during morphogenesis remains largely an open question in both plant and animal biology. This is partially due to the complexity of the process, involving extensive molecular networks, multiple feedbacks between different scales of organization and physical forces operating at multiple levels. Here we present a conceptual and modeling framework aimed at generating an integrated understanding of morphogenesis in plants. This framework is based on the biophysical properties of plant cells, which are under high internal turgor pressure, and are prevented from bursting because of the presence of a rigid cell wall. To control cell growth, the underlying molecular networks must interfere locally with the elastic and/or plastic extensibility of this cell wall. We present a model in the form of a three dimensional (3D) virtual tissue, where growth depends on the local modulation of wall mechanical properties and turgor pressure. The model shows how forces generated by turgor-pressure can act both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously to drive growth in different directions. We use simulations to explore lateral organ formation at the shoot apical meristem. Although different scenarios lead to similar shape changes, they are not equivalent and lead to different, testable predictions regarding the mechanical and geometrical properties of the growing lateral organs. Using flower development as an example, we further show how a limited number of gene activities can explain the complex shape changes that accompany organ outgrowth.},

  abstract = {Morphogenesis in plants and animals involves large irreversible deformations. In plants, the response of the cell wall material to internal and external forces is determined by its mechanical properties. An appropriate model for plant tissue growth must include key features such as anisotropic and heterogeneous elasticity and cell dependent evaluation of mechanical variables such as turgor pressure, stress and strain. In addition, a growth model needs to cope with cell divisions as a necessary part of the growth process. Here we develop such a growth model, which is capable of employing not only mechanical signals but also morphogen signals for regulating growth. The model is based on a continuous equation for updating the resting configuration of the tissue. Simultaneously, material properties can be updated at a different time scale. We test the stability of our model by measuring convergence of growth results for a tissue under the same mechanical and material conditions but with different spatial discretization. The model is able to maintain a strain field in the tissue during re-meshing, which is of particular importance for modeling cell division. We confirm the accuracy of our estimations in two and three-dimensional simulations, and show that residual stresses are less prominent if strain or stress is included as input signal to growth. The approach results in a model implementation that can be used to compare different growth hypotheses, while keeping residual stresses and other mechanical variables updated and available for feeding back to the growth and material properties.},

Auxin perception directly triggers the degradation of Aux/IAA repressor proteins. Here we describe a novel Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor termed DII-VENUS that was engineered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The VENUS fast maturing form of yellow fluorescent protein was fused in-frame to the Aux/IAA auxin-interaction domain (termed domain II; DII) and expressed under a constitutive promoter. We initially show that DII-VENUS abundance is dependent on auxin, its TIR1/AFBs co-receptors and proteasome activities. Next, we demonstrate that DII-VENUS provides a map of relative auxin distribution at cellular resolution in different tissues. DII-VENUS is also rapidly degraded in response to auxin and we used it to visualize dynamic changes in cellular auxin distribution successfully during two developmental responses, the root gravitropic response and lateral organ production at the shoot apex. Our results illustrate the value of developing response input sensors such as DII-VENUS to provide high-resolution spatio-temporal information about hormone distribution and response during plant growth and development.}

  abstract = {The lifespan of plants ranges from a few weeks in annuals to thousands of years in trees. It is hard to explain such extreme longevity considering that DNA replication errors inevitably cause mutations. Without purging through meiotic recombination, the accumulation of somatic mutations will eventually result in mutational meltdown, a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet. Nevertheless, the lifespan of trees is limited more often by incidental disease or structural damage than by genetic aging. The key determinants of tree architecture are the axillary meristems, which form in the axils of leaves and grow out to form branches. The number of branches is low in annual plants, but in perennial plants iterative branching can result in thousands of terminal branches. Here, we use stem cell ablation and quantitative cell-lineage analysis to show that axillary meristems are set aside early, analogous to the metazoan germline. While neighboring cells divide vigorously, axillary meristem precursors maintain a quiescent state, with only 7-9 cell divisions occurring between the apical and axillary meristem. During iterative branching, the number of branches increases exponentially, while the number of cell divisions increases linearly.~Moreover, computational modeling shows that stem~cell arrangement and positioning of axillary meristems distribute somatic mutations around the main~shoot, preventing their fixation and maximizing genetic heterogeneity. These features slow down Muller's ratchet and thereby extend lifespan.},

Composite interval mapping revealed the presence of 78 QTL affecting the 18 quantitative traits of interest, with 2–10 QTL per trait. Each QTL explained 3.0–68.0\% of the phenotypic variance, although only 4 (corresponding to 3 of 18 traits) had effects \&gt;25\%. Overall, 51 of the 78 QTL produced phenotypic effects in the expected direction, and for 13 of 18 traits the majority of QTL had the expected effect. Despite being distributed across 15 of the 17 linkage groups, there was a substantial amount of clustering among QTL controlling different traits. In several cases, regions influencing multiple traits harbored QTL with antagonistic effects, producing a cultivar-like phenotype for some traits and a wild-like phenotype for others. On the basis of the directionality of QTL, strong directional selection for increased achene size appears to have played a central role in sunflower domestication. None of the other traits show similar evidence of selection. The occurrence of numerous wild alleles with cultivar-like effects, combined with the lack of major QTL, suggests that sunflower was readily domesticated.},

Although much is known about the genes involved in the specification of procambium, phloem and xylem, the dynamic processes and interactions that define the development of the radial arrangement of such tissues remain elusive. Methods This study presents a spatially explicit reaction–diffusion model defining a set of logical and functional rules to simulate the differentiation of procambium, phloem and xylem and their spatial patterns, starting from a homogeneous group of undifferentiated cells. Key Results Simulation results showed that the model is capable of reproducing most vascular patterns observed in plants, from primitive and simple structures made up of a single strand of vascular bundles (protostele), to more complex and evolved structures, with separated vascular bundles arranged in an ordered pattern within the plant section (e.g. eustele). Conclusions The results presented demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that a common genetic–molecular machinery can be the basis of different spatial patterns of plant vascular development. Moreover, the model has the potential to become a useful tool to test different hypotheses of genetic and molecular interactions involved in the specification of vascular tissues.},

Nematode-related problems were recognized in the early 1900s by N. A. Cobb. From 1920 to approximately 1945 nematode management in Hawaiian pineapple was based on fallowing and crop rotation. During the 1920s and 1930s G. H. Godfrey conducted research on pineapple nematode management. In the 1930s and 1940s M. B. Linford researched biological control and described several new species of nematodes including Rotylenchulus reniformis. In 1941 nematology and nematode management were advanced by Walter Carter's discovery of the first economical soil fumigant for nematodes, D-D mixture. Subsequently, DBCP was discovered and developed at the Pineapple Research Institute (PRI). Since 1945 soil fumigation has been the main nematode management strategy in Hawaiian pineapple production. Recent research has focused on the development of the nonvolatile nematicides, their potential as systemic nematicides, and their application via drip irrigation. Current and future research addresses biological and cultural alternatives to nematicide-based nematode management.},

In both florets, reproductive development starts with the conversion of apical meristem into floral meristem that will produce floral organ primordia. The only difference between hermaphrodite and pistillate florets in apical meristem stage is that apical meristem of the pistillate florets is not as apparent and curvaceous as apical meristem of the hermaphrodite florets. The differentiation of apical meristem into floral meristem is in the same progress in both florets. In hermaphrodite florets, flower organs; petals, stamens and carpels develop from floral meristem. Differentiation of five petal primordia takes place in the same way in both florets. Firstly filament and then anther differentiates in a stamen. Two carpel primordia appear below the stamen primordia in hermaphrodite florets. In following stages, carpel primordia are lengthened and formed inferior ovary, style, stigma respectively. In pistillate florets, flower organs; petals and carpels develop from floral meristem. They pass directly from the periant initiation to the start of carpel formation. Stamen primordia don’t appear and the further development of carpel primordia stops in a short time, as a result, stigma and style do not exist in pistillate florets . However, an inferior ovary with no ovule forms.

  abstract = {The cotyledon represents one of the bases of classification within the plant kingdom, providing the name-giving difference between dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. It is also a fundamental organ and there have been many reports of cotyledon mutants in many species. The use of these mutants where they have arisen in Arabidopsis has allowed us to unravel some of the complexities of embryonic patterning and cotyledon development with a high degree of resolution. The cloning of genes involved in cotyledon development from other species, together with physiological work, has supported the hypothesis that there exists a small number of orthologous gene hierarchies, particularly those involving auxin. The time is therefore appropriate for a summary of the regulation of cotyledon development gleaned from cotyledon mutants and regulatory pathways in the model species Arabidopsis and what can be inferred from cotyledon mutants in other species. There is an enormous variation in cotyledon form and development throughout the plant kingdom and this review focuses on debates about the phylogenetic relationship between mono- and dicotyledony, discusses gymnosperm cotyledon development and pleiocotyly in natural populations, and explores the limits of homology between cotyledons and leaves.},

  abstract = {This paper details a simple diffusion theory model which provides an explanation for the formation of spiral phyllotaxis patterns in dicotyledonous plants. It is suggested that leaf formation at the shoot apex is dependent on the appropriate critical concentrations of two substances one of which diffuses in a polar direction from the apex and the other which diffuses isotropically from regions at the ends of the vascular system. Leaf initiation at the creation centre causes the latter substance to be sequestered or consumed and this provides the basic driving force for pattern formation. Using the same notations it is also possible to describe the system conventionally on the basis of inhibitor production at a creation centre. It is shown that the model is able to produce the basic phyllotaxis patterns that are observed naturally and that these conform to classical descriptions using phyllotaxis indices and ratios. Additionally, it is demonstrated that only a restricted range of leaf divergence angles is possible using a wide range of growth parameters in the model. In many cases quite large changes in these have little effect upon the final divergence angle produced.},

  abstract = {The genetic basis of floral symmetry is a topic of great interest because of its effect on pollinator behavior and, consequently, plant diversification. The Asteraceae, which is the largest family of flowering plants, is an ideal system in which to study this trait, as many species within the family exhibit a compound inflorescence containing both bilaterally symmetric (i.e., zygomorphic) and radially symmetric (i.e., actinomorphic) florets. In sunflower and related species, the inflorescence is composed of a single whorl of ray florets surrounding multiple whorls of disc florets. We show that in double-flowered (dbl) sunflower mutants (in which disc florets develop bilateral symmetry), such as those captured by Vincent van Gogh in his famous nineteenth-century sunflower paintings, an insertion into the promoter region of a CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like gene (HaCYC2c) that is normally expressed specifically in WT rays is instead expressed throughout the inflorescence, presumably resulting in the observed loss of actinomorphy. This same gene is mutated in two independent tubular-rayed (tub) mutants, though these mutations involve apparently recent transposon insertions, resulting in little or no expression and radialization of the normally zygomorphic ray florets. Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of CYC-like genes from across the family suggests that different paralogs of this fascinating gene family have been independently recruited to specify zygomorphy in different species within the Asteraceae.},

  abstract = {The plant hormone auxin plays an essential role in the patterning of plant structures. Biological hypotheses supported by computational models suggest that auxin may fulfil this role by regulating its own transport, but the plausibility of previously proposed models has been questioned. We applied the notion of unidirectional fluxes and the formalism of Petri nets to show that the key modes of auxin-driven patterning-the formation of convergence points and the formation of canals-can be implemented by biochemically plausible networks, with the fluxes measured by dedicated tally molecules or by efflux and influx carriers themselves. Common elements of these networks include a positive feedback of auxin efflux on the allocation of membrane-bound auxin efflux carriers (PIN proteins), and a modulation of this allocation by auxin in the extracellular space. Auxin concentration in the extracellular space is the only information exchanged by the cells. Canalization patterns are produced when auxin efflux and influx act antagonistically: an increase in auxin influx or concentration in the extracellular space decreases the abundance of efflux carriers in the adjacent segment of the membrane. In contrast, convergence points emerge in networks in which auxin efflux and influx act synergistically. A change in a single reaction rate may result in a dynamic switch between these modes, suggesting plausible molecular implementations of coordinated patterning of organ initials and vascular strands predicted by the dual polarization theory.},

  abstract = {Architectural properties of a fruit, such as its shape, vascular patterns, and skin morphology, play a significant role in determining the distributions of water, carbohydrates, and nutrients inside the fruit. Understanding the impact of these properties on fruit quality is difficult because they develop over time and are highly dependent on both genetic and environmental controls. We present a 3D functional-structural fruit model that can be used to investigate effects of the principle architectural properties on fruit quality. We use a three step modeling pipeline in the OpenAlea platform: (1) creating a 3D volumetric mesh representation of the internal and external fruit structure, (2) generating a complex network of vasculature that is embedded within this mesh, and (3) integrating aspects of the fruit’s function, such as water and dry matter transport, with the fruit’s structure. We restrict our approach to the phase where fruit growth is mostly due to cell expansion and the fruit has already differentiated into different tissue types. We show how fruit shape affects vascular patterns and, as a consequence, the distribution of sugar/water in tomato fruit. Furthermore, we show that strong interaction between tomato fruit shape and vessel density induces, independently of size, an important and contrasted gradient of water supply from the pedicel to the blossom end of the fruit. We also demonstrate how skin morphology related to microcracking distribution affects the distribution of water and sugars inside nectarine fruit. Our results show that such a generic model permits detailed studies of various, unexplored architectural features affecting fruit quality development.},

  abstract = {During the twentieth century, Amazonia was widely regarded as relatively pristine nature, little impacted by human history. This view remains popular despite mounting evidence of substantial human influence over millennial scales across the region. Here, we review the evidence of an anthropogenic Amazonia in response to claims of sparse populations across broad portions of the region. Amazonia was a major centre of crop domestication, with at least 83 native species containing populations domesticated to some degree. Plant domestication occurs in domesticated landscapes, including highly modified Amazonian dark earths (ADEs) associated with large settled populations and that may cover greater than 0.1\% of the region. Populations and food production expanded rapidly within land management systems in the mid-Holocene, and complex societies expanded in resource-rich areas creating domesticated landscapes with profound impacts on local and regional ecology. ADE food production projections support estimates of at least eight million people in 1492. By this time, highly diverse regional systems had developed across Amazonia where subsistence resources were created with plant and landscape domestication, including earthworks. This review argues that the Amazonian anthrome was no less socio-culturally diverse or populous than other tropical forested areas of the world prior to European conquest.},

  abstract = {La phyllotaxie d' Helianthus annuus L. montre de facon constante une disposition initiale opposée décussée faisant place plus ou moins vite à une disposition alterne, ou plus rarement à une disposition verticillée par trois. Phyllotaxy of Helianthus annuus L. shows a consistent manner opposite decussate original provision making up more or less quickly to a provision alternates , or more rarely a provision by three whorled. Phyllotaxy Helianthus annuus L. constant shows how opposite decussate original provision giving way or slower alternates with a provision or a provision rarely whorled by three more. All plants Helianthus annuus L. lost sooner or later before flowering the opposed arrangement decussate which is their original. When the arrangement is opposite decussate, the operation of almost all of the initial ring determines each whorl to the presence of very large leaf segments, being joined at their edges occupy entirely the periphery of the rod (Fig. 1) . The first disturbance on said opposite decussate arrangement consists of a separation of the two formations of a same leaf whorl. It thus sends a intersegment (space between two leaf segments on the surface of the rod).The leaves of the whorl are not opposed, although qu'insérées the same level; on one side they are joined to each other are separated by the inter-segment (Fig. 2). They say they are bijuguées. This happens sometimes from the second whorl above the cotyledons (20 cases studied), sometimes from the third whorl (43\%), sometimes from the fourth whorl (25\%), and rarely from the fifth ( 8 cases observed in 200 plants). Two or three successive whorls frequently have such a provision (see fig. 2 and 3). The inter-segment present on these whorls draw on the shank a helical area which shows the existence and the direction of winding of leaf propellers. The facts described above are general for the lot studied, but occur earlier or later before flowering. Sometimes it happens that the intersegment is visible on only one whorl in this case one has no indication of the direction of winding foliar helices. When the inter-segment is visible on these whorls, it is of increasing width and often may reach half the width of a leaf segment. It rarely exceeds this size. Then there is a further leaf formation produced by the region of the initial ring corresponding to the intersegment last whorl (Fig. 5). This training is the first production of a new generator and third center. The three leaf propellers are often offset to this level and the direction of winding may be reversed (fig. 4). The three centers rarely operate synchronously to provide three leaf whorls (Fig. 6), most often the leaves of three helices appear alone, the provision alternate, and there is usually more intersegment. When the width of the intersegment does not change, we do not observe additional training. The two helices are placed side by side, but the shift in the space corresponding to the intersegment, adds a time lag and the sheets are fed individually on the shaft (Fig. 7). Increasing the number of leaf propellers can continue using the same procedure and result in the operation of four generators centers this occurs just before flowering (Fig. 8). Conclusions: The rotation of the growing intersegment the position clearly indicates the winding direction of the two propellers of the leaf base. A third center generator works only when the inter-segment has reached a width greater than or equal to half the width of a segment of the leaf whorl.When the area of the initial ring, matching the growing inter-segment reaches a sufficient size, it gives often out of step with the normal whorls, foliar training, first production of a new generator center.

  abstract = {Finally codified in 1945 after several years of research, Le Corbusier’s Modulor is probably the most comprehensive proportional system imagined during the 20th century. Developed through contacts with consultants such as art historian Elisa Maillard, and referring to statistical measurements of the human body, the Modulor concluded decades of discourse on proportions, a theme that preoccupied Le Corbusier ever since his sojourn in Germany in 1910. Matila Ghyka’s work on the golden section was one of the sources for the Modulor, but his work in general was used by other architects, such as Le Corbusier’s rival André Lurçat, who proposed his own range of proportions related to the work of builders as much as to that of designers. Proportions thus became a central issue in the postwar French reconstruction, as architects struggled to maintain their status amid changing procedures in building production.},

  abstract = {Complex biological patterns are often governed by simple mathematical rules. A favourite botanical example is the apparent relationship between phyllotaxis (i.e. the arrangements of leaf homologues such as foliage leaves and floral organs on shoot axes) and the intriguing Fibonacci number sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 . . .). It is frequently alleged that leaf primordia adopt Fibonacci-related patterns in response to a universal geometrical imperative for optimal packing that is supposedly inherent in most animate and inanimate structures. This paper reviews the fundamental properties of number sequences, and discusses the under-appreciated limitations of the Fibonacci sequence for describing phyllotactic patterns. The evidence presented here shows that phyllotactic whorls of leaf homologues are not positioned in Fibonacci patterns. Insofar as developmental transitions in spiral phyllotaxis follow discernible Fibonacci formulae, phyllotactic spirals are therefore interpreted as being arranged in genuine Fibonacci patterns. Nonetheless, a simple modelling exercise argues that the most common spiral phyllotaxes do not exhibit optimal packing. Instead, the consensus starting to emerge from different subdisciplines in the phyllotaxis literature supports the alternative perspective that phyllotactic patterns arise from local inhibitory interactions among the existing primordia already positioned at the shoot apex, as opposed to the imposition of a global imperative of optimal packing. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 150, 3–24.},

  abstract = {Colour variation in the peppered moth Biston betularia was long accepted to be under strong natural selection. Melanics were believed to be fitter than pale morphs because of lower predation at daytime resting sites on dark, sooty bark. Melanics became common during the industrial revolution, but since 1970 there has been a rapid reversal, assumed to have been caused by predators selecting against melanics resting on today's less sooty bark. Recently, these classical explanations of melanism were attacked, and there has been general scepticism about birds as selective agents. Experiments and observations were accordingly carried out by Michael Majerus to address perceived weaknesses of earlier work. Unfortunately, he did not live to publish the results, which are analysed and presented here by the authors. Majerus released 4864 moths in his six-year experiment, the largest ever attempted for any similar study. There was strong differential bird predation against melanic peppered moths. Daily selection against melanics ( s ≃ 0.1) was sufficient in magnitude and direction to explain the recent rapid decline of melanism in post-industrial Britain. These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths.},

Specimens exhibiting the various possible phyllotactic modes (Fibonacci spirals, Lucas spirals, bijugate spirals etc...) were selected. The transitions from the initial decussate growth to these organizations, were characterized and shown to correspond to only a few archetypes. The possible transients from a decussate mode were then investigated in the model of self organization introduced by Douady and Couder (1996a, b, c). They are shown to exhibit the same phenomenology as the observed ones. These various transients have a very different probability of ccurrence which explains the difference of their frequency in plants. Finally the imperfections of the observed dispositions, which affect mainly the plastochron, are also investigated. The model provides an interpretation of this apparent disorder: after a transition the system optimizes the regularity of the parastichies but in doing so it disturbs the plastochron and the divergence. It is only when very large external disturbances affect the system that a real disorder is generated. In these latter cases the parastichies themselves disappear.},

The standard deviation from the mean was 8.583⚬. The normal phyllotaxis system has its origin in the one-half or decussate arrangement in bud or seedling development. The normal system was established in bud development between the seventh and ninth units and in seedling development between the seventh and eleventh units.},

  abstract = {The spatial arrangement of leaves and flowers around the stem, known as phyllotaxis, is controlled by an auxin-dependent reiterative mechanism that leads to regular spacing of the organs and thereby to remarkably precise phyllotactic patterns. The mechanism is based on the active cellular transport of the phytohormone auxin by cellular influx and efflux carriers, such as AUX1 and PIN1. Their important role in phyllotaxis is evident from mutant phenotypes, but their exact roles in space and time are difficult to address due to the strong pleiotropic phenotypes of most mutants in phyllotaxis. Models of phyllotaxis invoke the accumulation of auxin at leaf initials and removal of auxin through their developing vascular strand, the midvein. We have developed a precise microsurgical tool to ablate the midvein at high spatial and temporal resolution in order to test its function in leaf formation and phyllotaxis. Using amplified femtosecond laser pulses, we ablated the internal tissues in young leaf primordia of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) without damaging the overlying L1 and L2 layers. Our results show that ablation of the future midvein leads to a transient accumulation of auxin in the primordia and to an increase in their width. Phyllotaxis was transiently affected after midvein ablations, but readjusted after two plastochrons. These results indicate that the developing midvein is involved in the basipetal transport of auxin through young primordia, which contributes to phyllotactic spacing and stability.},

  abstract = {EDOUARD LUCAS IS STUDIED AS ONE OF THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE FIGURES IN THE MIDDLE OF FRENCH ARITHMETICIANS OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY. BIOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS ARE PRESENT IN THE FIRST PART OF THE THESIS, AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS ADDRESSED BY LUCAS, THE PLACES OF EXPRESSION AND PUBLICATION OF ITS RESULTS, THE CAREER PROBLEMS THAT IT ENCOUNTERS. A SECOND PART IS DEDICATED TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN THEORETICAL RESULTS DRAWN UP BY EDOUARD LUCAS: SMALL FIRM THEOREM, PREIMALITY TESTS, QUICK CALCULATION METHODS AND THE ALGORITHMS THAT DERIVE. OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SYMBOLIC CALCULATION (THROUGH THE NUMBERS OF BERNOULLI AND EULER), TO TISSUE GEOMETRY, TO SITUATION GEOMETRY ARE ALSO STUDIED. THE ROLE PLAYED BY LUCAS IN THE DESIGN OF AN ARITHMETIC INSTRUMENT FOR TESTING THE PRIMALITY OF CERTAIN LARGE NUMBERS IS HIGHLIGHTED, AS WELL AS ITS EFFORTS FOR THE RE-PUBLISHING OF THE FERMAT WORKS. THE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP OF EDOUARD LUCAS WITH THE FRENCH ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT, ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, ITS POSTERITY MORE ABROAD (ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES) THAN IN FRANCE, ARE QUESTIONS STUDYED IN A LAST PART The Fibonacci Suite The sequence of Leonardo da Pisa (known as Fibonacci) is governed by the relation of reactance u0 • 2 = u, .1 + u0. The expression of his general outfit depends on the choice of the first two outfits u0 and u1, which Fibonacci takes equal to O and 1 respectively; we thus obtain the sequence of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ... Lucas devotes a generous memoir published in Italy in 187723 to Leonard Pisa. Attention to the arithmetic properties of the Fibonacci sequence, which dates back to Fenuat, Frénide (and probably to earlier mathematicians), could have been aroused by a note by Gabriel Lamé of 1844, where his utility for the detention of a upper limit of the number of operations to be carried out in the search for the large common divisor of two whole numbers, as well as by the arithmetic works of Angelo Genocchi from 1868-1869. The original contribution of Lucas consists in underlining a remarkable arithmetic property of this sequence: any prime number p appears there as a factor of a tarnished rank detained. It is the law of appearance of prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence, which constitutes a synthesis between certain results of Fe1mat and Lagrange.24 It can be noted that the search for prime numbers within arithmetic sequences seems to be much earlier than this work. Thus Euler is interested in the presence of prime numbers within the arithmetic progression 4n + 1. Legendre believes to prove in 1785 that "there are an infinity of prime numbers included in any progression arithmetic whose first term and reason are prime to each other [.]. This proposition is quite difficult to demonstrate, however one can ensure that it is true. I am content to indicate this means of demonstration which it would be too long to detail ...

Some biographical elements presented in the first part show that Lucas (and correlatively this whole milieu) exhibited marginal aspects, as witnessed by the nature of the problems tackled by Lucas, his results’ outlets for publication, and his career difficulties. The second part of this paper is devoted to the examination of Lucas’s principal theoretical results : Fermat’s ”little” theorem and primality tests. The conception of an arithmetical instrument designed for testing the primality of certain large numbers is the focus of the third part. More important abroad (and notably in the United States) than in France, the posterity of Lucas’s work is touched upon at the end of the article.},

  abstract = {Acantharia are marine planktonic unicellular eukaryotes within the Radiolaria and currently encompass nearly 50 genera and 150 species. They are distributed worldwide from subsurface to deep waters and appear to be most numerous in oligotrophic surface waters. Their main distinctive features are an internal star-shaped skeleton made of strontium sulfate mineral and an amoeboid cell that possesses multiple nuclei, extensive axopods and contractile myonemes. Acantharia feed on a large variety of prey, but some species are mixotrophs through symbiosis with intracellular eukaryotic microalgae, typically the haptophyte Phaeocystis. As part of their life cycle, some taxonomic groups form heavy cysts that rapidly sink to deep waters creating a biogeochemically relevant vertical flux of carbon, strontium and barium. Overall, Acantharia remain poorly studied, and our knowledge of their biology and ecology is still in its infancy. Key Concepts Acantharia are marine skeleton-bearing planktonic protists that form a monophyletic taxon among radiolarians within the super-group Rhizaria. Acantharia have a complex cellular organisation (e.g. presence of myonemes and axopods) and exhibit an internal skeleton made of strontium sulfate (celestite), enriched in barium and composed of spicules that follow a specific geometric pattern (i.e. Müller's law). There are nearly 50 genera and 150 species, distributed in several suborders, and most taxonomic criteria are based on skeleton morphology (e.g. central junction, form and shape of spicules). Acantharia are ubiquitous in the world's oceans, and particularly abundant in surface oligotrophic waters at tropical and subtropical latitudes, but remain largely overlooked due to rapid skeleton dissolution upon cell death and inappropriate sampling methods. Acantharia are primarily grazers with the use of their axopods, but several species are actually mixotrophs as they host intracellular symbiotic microalgae, making them significant primary consumers and producers in pelagic ecosystems. Some acantharian species undergo encystment that is part of the reproduction process in deep waters, creating a biogeochemically significant vertical flux of carbon, nitrogen and strontium in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones.},

Polar localized membrane proteins of the PIN1 family facilitate this transport, and recent observations suggest that auxin maxima created by these proteins are at the basis of organ initiation. This hypothesis is based on the visual, qualitative characterization of the complex distribution patterns of the PIN1 protein in . To take these analyses further, we investigated the properties of the patterns using computational modeling. The simulations reveal previously undescribed properties of PIN1 distribution. In particular, they suggest an important role for the meristem summit in the distribution of auxin. We confirm these predictions by further experimentation and propose a detailed model for the dynamics of auxin fluxes at the shoot apex.},

The duration of this phase remained unchanged across environments, whereas the rate of tissue expansion varied greatly. Floret initiation rate depended on meristem initial size and tissue-expansion rate. Thereafter, floret initiation continued without tissue expansion in the meristem, resulting in a rapid decrease of meristem area. * •\enspace A set of equations was proposed to predict floret initiation rate and floret number as a function of the rates of tissue expansion in the meristem before and during floret initiation.

  abstract = {Historically, the study of phyllotaxis was greatly helped by the simple description of botanical patterns by only two integer numbers, namely the number of helices (parastichies) in each direction tiling the plant stem. The use of parastichy numbers reduced the complexity of the study and created a proliferation of generalizations, among others the simple geometric model of lattices. Unfortunately, these simple descriptive method runs into difficulties when dealing with patterns presenting transitions or irregularities. Here, we propose several ways of addressing the imperfections of botanical reality. Using ontogenetic analysis, which follows the step-by-step genesis of the pattern, and crystallographic analysis, which reveal irregularity in its details, we show how to derive more information from a real botanical sample, in particular, about its irregularities and transitions. We present several examples, from the first explicit visualization of a normal Fibonacci parastichy number increase, to more exotic ones, including the quasi-symmetric patterns detected in simulations. We compare these observations qualitatively with the result of the disk-packing model, presenting evidence for the relevance of the model.},

In this first part the hypotheses put forward by Hofmeister (1868) for the formation of primordia are re-examined and shown to form the rules of such a system. By means of a physics experiment and a numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that this system gives rise to the self organization of the spiral phyllotactic structures. The dynamic is controlled by only one parameter,G, equivalent to Richard's plastochrome ratio (1951), which characterizes growth. The diagram representing the values of the divergence angle as a function of the plastochrome ratio resembles that obtained geometrically by van Iterson (1907). In the present results, however, only one branch of solutions is continuous for all values ofG; this difference with the geometrical results is important. The predominance of Fibonacci order in botany is related to this continuity: during the ontogeny, because of the continuous decrease inG, only this branch is followed. In this framework the build-up of such complex structures as the inflorescence of compositae is described.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a bifurcation study of a model widely used to discuss phyllotactic patterns, i.e., leaf arrangements. Although stable patterns can be easily obtained by numerical simulations, a stability or bifurcation analysis is hindered by the fact that the model is defined by an algorithm and not a dynamical system, mainly because new active elements are added at each step, and thus the dimension of the "natural" phase space is not conserved. Here a construction is presented by which a well defined dynamical system can be obtained, and a bifurcation analysis can be carried out. Stable and unstable patterns are found by an analytical relation, in which the roles of different growth mechanisms determining the shape is clarified. Then bifurcations are studied, especially anomalous scenarios due to discontinuities embedded in the original model. Finally, an explicit formula for evaluation of the Jacobian, and thus the eigenvalues, is given. It is likely that problems of the above type often arise in biology, and especially in morphogenesis, where growing systems are modeled.},

  abstract = {From the more than 100 liver diseases described, many of those with high incidence rates manifest themselves by histopathological changes, such as hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver disease, fibrosis, and, in its later stages, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, primary biliary cirrhosis and other disorders. Studies of disease pathogeneses are largely based on integrating -omics data pooled from cells at different locations with spatial information from stained liver structures in animal models. Even though this has led to significant insights, the complexity of interactions as well as the involvement of processes at many different time and length scales constrains the possibility to condense disease processes in illustrations, schemes and tables. The combination of modern imaging modalities with image processing and analysis, and mathematical models opens up a promising new approach towards a quantitative understanding of pathologies and of disease processes. This strategy is discussed for two examples, ammonia metabolism after drug-induced acute liver damage, and the recovery of liver mass as well as architecture during the subsequent regeneration process. This interdisciplinary approach permits integration of biological mechanisms and models of processes contributing to disease progression at various scales into mathematical models. These can be used to perform in silico simulations to promote unravelling the relation between architecture and function as below illustrated for liver regeneration, and bridging from the in vitro situation and animal models to humans. In the near future novel mechanisms will usually not be directly elucidated by modelling. However, models will falsify hypotheses and guide towards the most informative experimental design.},

This transference of a flower-like appearance into an inflorescence level is considered as the key innovation for the rapid tribal radiation of Asteraceae. Recent molecular data indicate that Asteraceae flower heads resemble single flowers not only morphologically but also at molecular level. We summarize this data giving examples of how rewiring of conserved floral regulators have led to evolution of morphological innovations in Asteraceae. Functional diversification of the highly conserved flower meristem identity regulator LEAFY has shown a major role in the evolution of the capitulum architecture. Furthermore, gene duplication and subsequent sub- and neofunctionalization of SEPALLATA- and CYCLOIDEA-like genes in Asteraceae have been shown to contribute to meristem determinacy, as well as flower type differentiation—key traits that specify this large family. Future challenge is to integrate genomic, as well as evolutionary developmental studies in a wider selection of Asteraceae species to understand the detailed gene regulatory networks behind the elaborate inflorescence architecture, and to promote our understanding of how changes in regulatory mechanisms shape development.},

This specification has the form k(m, n) or k(m, n, m+n), where m, n, and (m+n) are parastichy numbers specifying screw displacements, and k is the jugacy, or frequency of rotational symmetry. For simple structures, k = 1.

Their symmetry properties are discussed. Parameters of these models, such as the angular divergence, [agr], the longitudinal displacement between successive spheres, h, the radius of the cylinder, and the angles of inclination of the parastichies, have been computed for representative patterns.The ultrastructural symmetry of several biological structures of this sort has been inferred by comparison with these models. Actin, for example, has the symmetry (1, 2), Salmonella flagella, 2(2, 3, 5), the tobacco mosaic virus, (1, 16, 17) and the microtubules of many higher organisms, (6, 7, 13). 10.1126/science.181.4101.705},

  abstract = {Murray [née Clarke], Joan Elisabeth Lowther (1917–1996), cryptanalyst and numismatist, was born at 45 Idmiston Road, West Norwood, London, on 24 June 1917, the youngest child (there were three sons, and another daughter) of William Kemp Lowther Clarke, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Dorothy Elizabeth Fulford. She was educated at Dulwich high school and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she obtained a double first in mathematics and was a wrangler. While still an undergraduate, she was recruited by Gordon Welchman for the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS) at Bletchley Park, the British code-breaking centre during the Second World War. When she joined GCCS in June 1940, she was assigned to Hut 8, which was responsible for the solution of naval Enigma ciphers. These were among the most difficult GCCS had to attack, partly because the naval Enigma machine, M3, was issued with eight rotors, compared with five for army and air force Enigma. She worked in a small inner room as a cryptanalyst with Alan Turing, Peter Twinn, and Tony Kendrick. Her initial task was to use the first British bombe (a high-speed key-finding aid invented by Alan Turing), which had entered service on 18 March 1940, against documents captured from the patrol boat Schiff 26. These enabled her and her co-workers to break about six days of April traffic over a period of three months. Clarke helped to test Banburismus, a highly ingenious procedure invented by Turing, which used Bayesian probability theory to reduce the number of M3 rotor combinations to be tested by the bombes from 336 to between 6 and 126. She became very adept at Banburismus, which she greatly enjoyed. Without it, the solving of naval Enigma would have been much slower, since bombes were in very short supply until mid-1943. Hut 8 could not make further progress until Enigma keys and indicator books were captured in February and May 1941. Its cryptanalysts therefore sometimes worked on other Enigma ciphers. When the outstandingly versatile Colonel John Tiltman recovered the plain text of signals enciphered on railway Enigma (a rewired version, codenamed Rocket by GCCS, of commercial Enigma) in July 1940, Clarke helped to recover the wiring of its rotors, and to solve Rocket traffic in early 1941. She returned to naval Enigma in March 1941, when GCCS received Enigma key lists taken from an armed trawler, Krebs. She worked on material recovered from a patrol boat, München, which, with other captures, led to the speedy breaking of the main naval Enigma key, Heimisch (known to GCCS as Dolphin) from August 1941 onwards; keys were captured for June and July. One of her important contributions accelerated the solution of naval Offizier signals, which were extremely difficult to break, since they were re-enciphered with a second set of plugboard settings (which interchanged ten pairs of letters), adding 150,000,000,000,000 further possible settings to a key. Clarke became engaged to Turing in the spring of 1941, although the engagement was kept secret, and she did not wear her ring in Hut 8. The engagement was broken off by mutual consent in the late summer because of Turing's homosexuality. She remained friends with Turing for the rest of his life. In mid-December 1942, after a blackout of almost 11 months, Hut 8 broke into the critically important four-rotor Enigma key, Triton (codenamed Shark by GCCS), which was used by the Atlantic U-boats. However, in early March GCCS had to warn the Admiralty that Shark and its vital intelligence might again be lost, possibly for months. Clarke helped to ensure that naval intelligence's worst fear was not realized. Hut 8 was forced to use extremely short extracts (sometimes of only four letters) from short ‘sighting’ signals from the U-boats to program the three-rotor bombes until four-rotor bombes entered service in June 1943. At the end of 1943 US Navy code-breakers in OP-20-G were allotted responsibility for breaking Shark, because US Navy four-rotor bombes were much more reliable and plentiful than the British model. Clarke remained in Hut 8 as a highly capable member of a small team which initially concentrated on M3 ciphers, such as Dolphin, although it continued to break some Shark keys until early 1945. After the war Clarke worked in GCHQ, as GCCS became, until her marriage in 1952. Her husband was Lieutenant-Colonel John Kenneth Ronald (Jock) Murray, a retired army officer in India, who also worked at GCHQ. They had no children. She rejoined GCHQ in 1962 and retired in 1977. After her retirement she helped Sir Harry Hinsley on appendix 30 to volume 3/2 of British Intelligence in the Second World War, which was a substantially revised assessment of the Polish, French, and British work in breaking Enigma. Murray was a gifted numismatist whose research was recognized by the award of the prestigious Sanford Saltus medal in 1987; this was for a 'magisterial paper' which established 'the sequence of the gold unicorns and heavy groats of James III and James IV [of Scotland], an extremely complex series which had caused great difficulty for previous students' (Numismatic Circular, 405). Joan Murray was unique as the only female cryptanalyst to work in Hut 8. She was also its longest-serving member. Her acute intelligence enabled her fully to hold her own with her co-workers in Hut 8, and to make a significant contribution to its work in helping the allies to win the battle of the Atlantic, among other successes. She was also known as one of the really good cryptanalysts in GCHQ. Although very shy and retiring, she was an enthusiastic and encouraging colleague, and was much liked and admired by all who worked with her at GCCS and GCHQ. She was appointed MBE in 1947. Murray died on 4 September 1996 at her home, 7 Larkfields, Headington, Oxford. She was predeceased by her husband. Sources R. E. [R. Erskine], ‘In memoriam: Joan E. L.

  abstract = {* Background and Aims Plant lateral organs such as leaves arise from a group of initial cells within the flanks of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Alterations in the initiation of lateral organs are often associated with changes in the dimension and arrangement of the SAM as well as with abnormal hormonal homeostasis. A mutation named stem fasciated (stf) that affects various aspects of plant development, including SAM shape and auxin level, was characterized in sunflower (Helianthus annuus). * Methods F1, F2 and F3 generations were obtained through reciprocal crosses between stf and normal plants. For the genetic analysis, a \{chi\}2 test was used. Phenotypic observations were made in field-grown and potted plants. A histological analysis of SAM, hypocotyl, epicotyl, stem and root apical meristem was also conducted. To evaluate the level of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring analysis was performed. * Key Results stf is controlled by a single nuclear recessive gene. stf plants are characterized by a dramatically increased number of leaves and vascular bundles in the stem, as well as by a shortened plastochron and an altered phyllotaxis pattern. By histological analysis, it was demonstrated that the stf phenotype is related to an enlarged vegetative SAM. Microscopy analysis of the mutant's apex also revealed an abnormal enlargement of nuclei in both central and peripheral zones and a disorganized distribution of cells in the L2 layer of the central zone. The stf mutant showed a high endogenous free IAA level, whereas auxin perception appeared normal. * Conclusions The observed phenotype and the high level of auxin detected in stf plants suggest that the STF gene is necessary for the proper initiation of primordia and for the establishment of a phyllotactic pattern through control of both SAM arrangement and hormonal homeostasis. 10.1093/aob/mcl153},

An interpretation of these angles is attempted. Since they characterize the functioning of a morphogenetic field, a formalism was constructed suitable for the study of living systems. The mathematical tool devised here, named the Arithmetical Relator, combines Geometry and Arithmetic, and assumes that a general system results from the interaction between an internal cyclic structure and an environment to which this structure is adapted. The formalism described therefore takes into account partial self-reference and changes in the level of organization. Within this framework, the particular values of the ramification angles are extreme for slight shifts in the internal structure. A pattern of the relations between the genome, the cell and the organ is suggested.},

In case of the black pine~ it appeared that the greater the deviation of the parastichy quotient m/n from 0.618, the rarer the pattern. Similar results obtained for the sample of 1506 cones collected from three individual trees of larch (Larix decidua Mill.) suggest a true correlation between the frequency of a pattern and the deviation of its parastichy quotient from the golden ratio.},

  abstract = {Neither the relationship between the chirality of spiral phyllotaxis and spiral wood grain nor the cause or ontogeny of such a relationship has been examined previously. To this end, chirality of the spiral in phyllotaxis of needle fascicles and cone scales were contrasted with wood-grain spiral in seedlings, young, and mature trees of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) in central British Columbia. To assess chirality of phyllotaxis, the relationship between numbers of contact parastichies and chirality of phyllotaxis in scales on cones and needle fascicles on branchlets was determined. Three or 8 clockwise acropetal contact parastichies were indicative of a clockwise generative spiral, while totals of 2, 5, or 13 clockwise acropetal parastichies were indicative of a counter-clockwise generative spiral. Lodgepole pine trees were nearly always chimeric, i.e., having clockwise and counter-clockwise phyllotaxis on the same individual, but there was a high overall correspondence between the chirality of phyllotaxis in cone scales and subtending needle fascicles. Seedlings ({$<$}1.5 years old) had no measurable wood-grain angle and clockwise and counter-clockwise phyllotaxis occurred in equal proportions. However, young trees (1315 years since planting) had a pronounced clockwise bias to their wood-grain spiral in contrast with a counter-clockwise bias in phyllotaxis. In contrast, mature trees (100 years old) had the reverse trend and exhibited a counter-clockwise bias in wood-grain spiral but a clockwise bias in phyllotaxis. A model is proposed to explain how chirality of spiral wood grain could generate an inverse bias in the chirality of phyllotaxis in lodgepole pine.Key words: lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. latifolia, phyllotaxis, generative spiral, Fibonacci numbers, spiral wood grain.},

  abstract = {Citizen science programs are increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, from public education to new opportunities for data collection. The literature published in scientific journals resulting from these projects represents a particular perspective on the process. These articles often conclude with recommendations for increasing "success". This study compared these recommendations to those elicited during interviews with program coordinators for programs within the United States. From this comparison, success cannot be unilaterally defined and therefore recommendations vary by perspective on success. Program coordinators tended to have more locally-tailored recommendations specific to particular aspects of their program mission.},

  abstract = {In multicellular organisms, not all cells are created equal. Instead, organismal complexity is achieved by specialisation and division of labour between distinct cell types. Therefore, the organism depends on the presence, correct proportion and function of all cell types. It follows that early development is geared towards setting up the basic body plan and to specify cell lineages. Since plants employ a post-embryonic mode of development, the continuous growth and addition of new organs require a source of new cells, as well as a strict regulation of cellular composition throughout the entire life-cycle. To meet these demands, evolution has brought about complex regulatory systems to maintain and control continuously active stem cell systems. Here, we review recent work on the mechanisms of non cell-autonomous control of shoot stem cells in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with a strong focus on the cell-to-cell mobility and function of the WUSCHEL homeodomain transcription factor.},

From these observation, it was considered that the change of leaf arrangement showed the time of the alternation from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. So, this experiment was carried out to study the relationship between change of phyllotaxy and growth phase. Morphological and histochemical methods were used in these studies and the results were as follows; (1) The change of leaf arrangement occurred at the middle of July. (2) At that time, the shoot apex changed slowly from flat type to dome type. (3) Histochemical change of the nucleic acid (RNA) indicated the change of the growth phase. From these results, it was considered that the change of phyllotaxy was applicable as an indicator of the alternation from vegetative growth to reproductive growth in Helianthus tuberosus L.}

The iterative generation of new aerial organs, (leaves, lateral inflorescences and flowers) at the meristem follows regular patterns, called phyllotaxis. Phyllotaxis has long been proposed to self-­‐organize from the combined action of growth and of inhibitory fields blocking organogenesis in the vicinity of existing organs in the meristem. In this review we will highlight how a combination of mathematical/computational modeling and experimental biology has demonstrated that the spatio-­‐temporal distribution of the plant hormone auxin controls both organogenesis and the establishment of inhibitory fields. We will discuss recent advances showing that auxin likely acts through a combination of biochemical and mechanical regulatory mechanisms that control not only the pattern of organogenesis in the meristem but also post-­‐meristematic growth, to shape the shoot.},

In plants, positional information provided by the hormone auxin regulates rhythmic organ production at the shoot apex, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of auxin gradients is unknown. We used quantitative imaging to demonstrate that auxin carries high-definition graded information not only in space but also in time. We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis. This provides a mechanism to temporally differentiate sites of organ initiation and exemplifies how spatio-temporal positional information can be used to create rhythmicity.},

We test these predictions by relating evolutionary shifts in form, physiology, and ecology to time and ancestral distributions, quantifying patterns of correlated and contingent evolution among pairs of traits and analyzing the apparent impact of individual traits on rates of net species diversification and geographic expansion beyond the ancestral Guayana Shield. All predicted patterns of correlated evolution were significant, and the temporal and spatial associations of phenotypic shifts with orogenies generally accorded with predictions. Net rates of species diversification were most closely coupled to life in fertile, moist, geographically extensive cordilleras, with additional significant ties to epiphytism, avian pollination, and the tank habit. The highest rates of net diversification were seen in the bromelioid tank-epiphytic clade (Dcrown = 1.05 MyÀ1), associated primarily with the Serra do Mar and nearby ranges of coastal Brazil, and in the core tillandsioids (Dcrown = 0.67 MyÀ1), associated primarily with the Andes and Central America. Six large-scale adaptive radiations and accompanying pulses of speciation account for 86\% of total species richness in the family. This study is among the first to test a priori hypotheses about the relationships among phylogeny, phenotypic evolution, geographic spread, and net species diversification, and to argue for causality to flow from functional diversity to spatial expansion to species diversity.},

  abstract = {Why living forms develop in a relatively robust manner, despite various sources of internal or external variability, is a fundamental question in developmental biology. Part of the answer relies on the notion of developmental constraints: at any stage of ontogenesis, morphogenetic processes are constrained to operate within the context of the current organism being built. One such universal constraint is the shape of the organism itself, which progressively channels the development of the organism toward its final shape. Here, we illustrate this notion with plants, where strikingly symmetric patterns (phyllotaxis) are formed by lateral organs. This Hypothesis article aims first to provide an accessible overview of phyllotaxis, and second to argue that the spiral patterns in plants are progressively canalized from local interactions of nascent organs. The relative uniformity of the organogenesis process across all plants then explains the prevalence of certain patterns in plants, i.e. Fibonacci phyllotaxis.},

Today, many individuals understand the fruit as a symbol of polite hospitality; I complicate this notion, turning to horticulture dictionaries and natural histories in order to reconstruct the eighteenth-century British fascination with this Caribbean fruit, arguing that the pineapple—as a fruit and a decorative object—also embodied notions of empire and difference.},

  abstract = {Phyllotaxis, the regular arrangement of leaves in plants, has been extensively studied geometrically and through theories of mechanism. Recent observations of the biophysics of cell growth and division at the plant apex during leaf formation lead to a "cut and grow" algorithm, in which a newly formed leaf is first cut off from the meristem and then grows rapidly, deforming the adjacent tissue to a new configuration. The properties of the sequence of shapes constructed by a cut-grow map of triangles are discussed. The cut-grow map excises a triangular segment of a triangle and dilates the newly formed edge. In shape space, the cut-grow map is equivalent to a reflection followed by inversion. Each map has a conjugate pair of "eigenshapes." In the limiting case when the eigenshapes are equal, the shapes converge with successive iterations at rate 1/n. However, an arbitrarily small perturbation from the eigenshape can initialize a divergent sequence of arbitrary length, before the shapes begin to converge. When the eigenshapes are unequal, the shapes at successive iterations traverse a circle, with center offset from both eigenshapes, and with period π/θ, where 2θ is the angle between the conjugate pair of eigenshapes. The phyllotactic pattern generated by traversals of the circle is a flattened version of regular phyllotaxis. It is concluded that an apex "programmed" with a given cut and grow algorithm will generate any given pattern of spiral phyllotaxis.},

Genes are important, but only as part of a process constrained by environment, physical laws, and the universal tendencies of complex adaptive systems.

  abstract = {This monograph presents a general mathematical theory for biological growth. It provides both a conceptual and a technical foundation for the understanding and analysis of problems arising in biology and physiology. The theory and methods are illustrated on a wide range of examples and applications.A process of extreme complexity, growth plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and is considered to be the hallmark of life itself. Its description has been one of the fundamental problems of life sciences, but until recently, it has not attracted much attention from mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. The author herein presents the first major technical monograph on the problem of growth since D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s 1917 book On Growth and Form.The emphasis of the book is on the proper mathematical formulation of growth kinematics and mechanics. Accordingly, the discussion proceeds in order of complexity and the book is divided into five parts. First, a general introduction on the problem of growth from a historical perspective is given. Then, basic concepts are introduced within the context of growth in filamentary structures. These ideas are then generalized to surfaces and membranes and eventually to the general case of volumetric growth. The book concludes with a discussion of open problems and outstanding challenges. Thoughtfully written and richly illustrated to be accessible to readers of varying interests and background, the text will appeal to life scientists, biophysicists, biomedical engineers, and applied mathematicians alike.},

  abstract = {Fifty years ago, Lewis Wolpert introduced the concept of “positional information” to explain how patterns form in a multicellular embryonic field. Using morphogen gradients, whose continuous distributions of positional values are discretized via thresholds into distinct cellular states, he provided, at the theoretical level, an elegant solution to the “French Flag problem.” In the intervening years, many experimental studies have lent support to Wolpert's ideas. However, the embryonic patterning of highly repetitive morphological structures, as often occurring in nature, can reveal limitations in the strict implementation of his initial theory, given the number of distinct threshold values that would have to be specified. Here, we review how positional information is complemented to circumvent these inadequacies, to accommodate tissue growth and pattern periodicity. In particular, we focus on functional anatomical assemblies composed of such structures, like the vertebrate spine or tetrapod digits, where the resulting segmented architecture is intrinsically linked to periodic pattern formation and unidirectional growth. These systems integrate positional information and growth with additional patterning cues that, we suggest, increase robustness and evolvability. We discuss different experimental and theoretical models to study such patterning systems, and how the underlying processes are modulated over evolutionary timescales to enable morphological diversification.},

The first in-depth and comprehensive look at his many accomplishments, Henri Poincaré explores all the fields that Poincaré touched, the debates sparked by his original investigations, and how his discoveries still contribute to society today. Math historian Jeremy Gray shows that Poincaré's influence was wide-ranging and permanent. His novel interpretation of non-Euclidean geometry challenged contemporary ideas about space, stirred heated discussion, and led to flourishing research. His work in topology began the modern study of the subject, recently highlighted by the successful resolution of the famous Poincaré conjecture. And Poincaré's reformulation of celestial mechanics and discovery of chaotic motion started the modern theory of dynamical systems. In physics, his insights on the Lorentz group preceded Einstein's, and he was the first to indicate that space and time might be fundamentally atomic. Poincaré the public intellectual did not shy away from scientific controversy, and he defended mathematics against the attacks of logicians such as Bertrand Russell, opposed the views of Catholic apologists, and served as an expert witness in probability for the notorious Dreyfus case that polarized France. Richly informed by letters and documents, Henri Poincaré demonstrates how one man's work revolutionized math, science, and the greater world"--},

  abstract = {When simple shoots and flowers are examined, a restricted set of patterns is found. Characterization involves three levels of scale: (1) The overall array is roughly radially symmetrical. (2) The elements within it are usually arranged in either straight radii or in spiral lines. (3) The element itself, e.g., a leaf or petal, has a plane of bilateral symmetry that lies on a radius of the overall array. Proposed morphogenetic mechanisms have centered on the second level, where the propagation of pattern is based on "feed forward," an influence of recently made primordia on the site of initiation of the next. This influence has been postulated to be chemical inhibition emanating from the center of each primordium. New primordia would arise in uninhibited regions and then produce inhibitor. An alternate candidate for this influence rests on the fact that the buckling of a constrained inanimate sheet can also propagate pattern. Bump formation on a sheet experiencing uniform upward pressure is influenced both by the boundary of the sheet and by humps already present on it. I propose that in meristems the tunica exhibits minimal energy buckling behavior, and the corpus supplies upward pressure. Simulations involving bumps can propagate patterns with straight or spiral configurations. This is feed-forward of pattern, at the second level. When bumps also develop adaxial creases tangential to the margin of the dome, these creases link the bilateral symmetry of the appendage with the overall radial symmetry (levels 1 and 3). By serving as an apparent new linear anchor for buckling of the dome, a new crease converts the influence of a leaf on the dome from modifying internal curvature to becoming an external boundary condition. Creases appear stiff and tend to form a ting. When such a ring is kept taut by internal pressure, it promotes radial symmetry, stabilizing the whole array. The biomechanical model ties together all three levels of scale. Cyclic buckling phenomena could explain why the number of patterns is restricted and why they take the form that they do.},

We show here that an initial undulating periodic pattern (a ‘whorl’ of hump-like organs) can arise in a flat unstructured annulus. The pattern arises not from pre-localized pushes from below, but rather as a spontaneous physical response of the expanding surface to lateral constraint. Physical properties of a uniform formative layer (tunica) and a uniform substratum (corpus) provide the wavelength of the undulation and hence the number of organs. Establishment of the parameters for this buckling, as well as the follow-through of organ development, is biological. We propose, however, that at the moment of periodic pattern initiation the plant tissue simply manifests the spontaneous but complex properties of a two-layered inanimate sheet.},

  abstract = {Patterns of leaves or florets, phyllotaxis, have long been well characterized using parameters that describe the patterns as lattices of points or arrangements of contiguous circles. The patterns are usually interpreted in terms of spiral lines drawn through the points or circles. For example, in a pine cone the number of visible spiral lines, in two sets with opposing spiral sense, is typically a pair of adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci series. This format for characterization, while precise and terse for spiral Fibonacci patterns, has four disadvantages or limitations when applied generally. First, when the spiral notation is applied to obviously orthogonal patterns, such as decussate, it implies developmental chirality even though the pattern has no intrinsic handedness. Second, the classification has led to no convenient subgrouping, of all patterns: i.e., do all forms with one organ per node constitute a natural group? Third, the characterization is of a static pattern based on an assumed constant center of symmetry. Characterization is not related to the mode of formation of the patterns. Finally, the notation is not convenient for describing gradual developmental transitions between patterns. We find that a broad range of phyllotactic patterns can be conveniently characterized by diagrams, each derived from a single measurement of the apical surface that produces the organs. During each developmental cycle, this area expands to a maximum and then is abruptly reduced to a minimum by demarcation of a new leaf (or leaves). The center of area is generally different before and after demarcation, hence its movement during the demarcation event is a vector. We present a method for juxtaposing these vectors over consecutive plastochrons. The resulting planar figure is diagnostic of the broad categories of phyllotaxis. In “balanced” forms, whorled apices, there is no net movement of the center of area so the resulting figure is a point. In the second category, “linear”, the vectors reverse, retracing a line segment. Leaves alternating in a plane, distichous phyllotaxy, arise from this pattern. In the third category, “polygonal”, the juxtaposed vectors advance so as to circumscribe a polygon. Such plants (some Euphorbias) generate leaves in helical sequence but the leaves stand in vertical ranks. In the fourth category, “circular” the vectors circumscribe a circle. This behavior is found in plants with irrational divergence angles and hence applies to the common Fibonacci spiral forms. The vectorial mode of primary categorization appears to lack the four listed shortcomings.},

In general, growth is at right angles to the reinforcement. When, however, tissues are actively stretched by adjacent organs they apparently take on, by cell activity, reinforcement which lies in the direction of stretch. Thus reinforcement can dictate extension direction; extension direction, when imposed on a tissue, may dictate reinforcement direction. This proposed two-way relationship has been used to model the activity of shoot meristems. It produces biophysically plausible schemes for the progressive development of various leaf structures and for the cyclical revision of apical structure seen in various types of phyllotaxis.},

Attention is called to the occurrence at the beginning or end of such changes, both spontaneous and experimentally induced, of leaves directly superimposed on the same orthostichy.

  abstract = {In vascular plants, the arrangement of organs around the stem generates geometric patterns called phyllotaxis. In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, as in the majority of species, single organs are initiated successively at a divergence angle from the previous organ close to the canonical angle of 137.5°, producing a Fibonacci spiral. Given that little is known about the robustness of these geometric arrangements, we undertook to characterize phyllotaxis by measuring divergence angles between organs along the stems of wild-type and specific mutant plants with obvious defects in phyllotaxis. Sequences of measured divergence angles exhibit segments of non-canonical angles in both genotypes, albeit to a far greater extent in the mutant. We thus designed a pipeline of methods for analyzing these perturbations. The latent structure models used in this pipeline combine a non-observable model representing perturbation patterns (either a variable-order Markov chain or a combinatorial model) with von Mises distributions representing divergence angle uncertainty. We show that the segments of non-canonical angles in both wild-type and mutant plants can be explained by permutations in the order of insertion along the stem of two or three consecutive organs. The number of successive organs between two permutations reveals specific patterns that depend on the nature of the preceding permutation (2- or 3-permutation). We also highlight significant individual deviations from 137.5° in the level of baseline segments and a marked relationship between permutation of organs and defects in the elongation of the internodes between these organs. These results demonstrate that permutations are an intrinsic property of spiral phyllotaxis and that their occurrence is genetically regulated.},

In its extreme form, found in ascidians, early embryonic cell lineages are invariant between embryos within and between species, despite rapid genomic divergence. To resolve this paradox, we used live light-sheet imaging to quantify individual cell behaviors in digitalized embryos and explore the forces that canalize their development. This quantitative approach revealed that individual cell geometries and cell contacts are strongly constrained, and that these constraints are tightly linked to the control of fate specification by local cell inductions. While in vertebrates ligand concentration usually controls cell inductions, we found that this role is fulfilled in ascidians by the area of contacts between signaling and responding cells. We propose that the duality between geometric and genetic control of inductions contributes to the counterintuitive inverse correlation between geometric and genetic variability during embryogenesis.},

However, collecting such data requires intensive and careful manual effort. One of the major challenges in imaging the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana, is that the deeper slices in the z-stack suffer from different perpetual quality-related problems like poor contrast and blurring. These quality-related issues often lead to the disposal of the painstakingly collected data with little to no control on quality while collecting the data. Therefore, it becomes necessary to employ and design techniques that can enhance the images to make them more suitable for further analysis. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Deep Quantized Latent Representation (DQLR) methodology for high-quality image reconstruction in the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our proposed framework utilizes multiple consecutive slices in the z-stack to learn a low dimensional latent space, quantize it and subsequently perform reconstruction using the quantized representation to obtain sharper images. Experiments on a publicly available dataset validate our methodology showing promising results.},

  abstract = {The morphology of plant fossils from the Rhynie chert has generated longstanding questions about vascular plant shoot and leaf evolution, for instance, which morphologies were ancestral within land plants, when did vascular plants first arise and did leaves have multiple evolutionary origins? Recent advances combining insights from molecular phylogeny, palaeobotany and evo–devo research address these questions and suggest the sequence of morphological innovation during vascular plant shoot and leaf evolution. The evidence pinpoints testable developmental and genetic hypotheses relating to the origin of branching and indeterminate shoot architectures prior to the evolution of leaves, and demonstrates underestimation of polyphyly in the evolution of leaves from branching forms in ‘telome theory’ hypotheses of leaf evolution. This review discusses fossil, developmental and genetic evidence relating to the evolution of vascular plant shoots and leaves in a phylogenetic framework. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘The Rhynie cherts: our earliest terrestrial ecosystem revisited’.},

  abstract = {Microtubules, bacterial flagella, viral capsids, and other biological structures are tubular packings of subunits. The subunits form helical rows or parastichies. Such arrays are modeled as tubular packings of spheres. Parastichies along which spheres are in contact provide a symbol for a particular tubule. A tubule with hexagonal packing and k-fold rotational symmetry about its axis has the symbol k(m; m + n; n) where km, k(m + n), and kn represent the three sets of contact parastichies. A tubule with rhombic packing has two sets of contact parastichies and the symbol k(m; n). The symbol determines the chirality. Two processes are described by which tubules can be interconverted: continuous contraction and discontinuous contraction. In continuous contraction of a hexagonally packed tubule, contacts along km-, k(m + n)-, or kn-parastichies are broken uniformly throughout the tubule. The tubule becomes rhombic and undergoes twisting and change of length and radius. Continuation of the process converts the intermediate rhombic packing into a new hexagonal packing. Any tubule can be converted to any other having the same rotational symmetry k, by one or more steps of continuous contraction, but not to a tubule with different k. With respect to change in length, continuous contraction from one hexagonal packing to another may be either monotonic or non-monotonic. A step of discontinuous contraction of a hexagonally packed tubule is mediated by passage of an edge dislocation through the tubule, by glide or climb. The presence of a single edge dislocation in a tubule divides it into two parts with two different packings. Passage of the dislocation to one end or the other of the tubule converts the entire tubule into one packing or the other. Any tubule may be converted to any other, regardless of k, by one or more steps of discontinuous contraction. Maps showing possible paths of continuous and discontinuous contraction summarize the relationships among tubules. The analysis will provide a useful basis for studying particular biological cases of contraction. ?? 1980.},

  abstract = {So far as Italy is concerned, the outstanding scientific genius of the thirteenth century is undoubtedly the mathematician Leonard of Pisa. [36] Beyond the fact of his African education, and his “sovereign possession of the whole mathematical knowledge of his own and every preceding generation," [37] his personal history is unknown; but though he resided at Pisa, he was well known to Frederick and the philosophers of his court, to whom his extant works are in large measure dedicated. It is Michael Scot who in 1228 receives from Leonard's hands the revised edition of his epoch-making treatise on the Abacus, first issued in 1202. [38] Already Master John of Palermo had accompanied Leonard into the emperor's presence and proposed questions involving quadratic and cubic equations, the answers to which are found in the Flos and Liber quadratorum [39].  Like the solutions of various problems submitted to Leonard by Master Theodore, these are designed to illustrate method rather than to form a systematic treatise. The Liber quadratorum is directed to the emperor, who has himself deigned to read the treatise on the Abacus and to hear the discussion of subtle problems of arithmetic and geometry, such as those once propounded in his presence by Master John.

The date 1225 which heads the Liber quadratorum has perplexed historians, since Frederick first visited Pisa in the following year. Enestrom has tried to reconcile the difficulties by placing the first meeting elsewhere: B. M., ix. 72 (1908).  40 Scritii, ii. 253.},

He traces the rise and fall of the corporate giants who dominated the global canning world for much of the twentieth century. Drawing from a host of familiar economic models and an unparalleled body of research, Hawkins analyses the entrepreneurial development and twentieth-century migration of the pineapple canning industry in Hawaii. The result is not only a comprehensive history, but also a unique story of American innovation and ingenuity amid the rising tides of globalization.},

Documents at the Fondation Le Corbusier show that this drawing was made at least 18 months after the original design. Moreover, the regulating lines here do not agree with those on an earlier drawing. The same sort of discrepancy is also found when comparing drawings of other early works. To explain the apparent contradictions and to understand Le Corbusier's method, his writings must be consulted. From these it becomes clear that the regulating lines were not used to design buildings but rather to modify or confirm the original plans. Hence more than one set of lines would fit a given structure. The plans for Garches must be understood in this light. When Le Corbusier took up the "golden number" he simply used it, after the fact, to further confirm his work at Garches. It is this later confirmation that we see in the Oeuvre complète.},

The ontogenetic graph is extracted from the local geometry of the pattern and does not impose large-scale regularity on it as for the divergence angle and other classical descriptors. We exemplify our approach by analyzing the phyllotaxis of two asteraceae inflorescences in the light of a hard disk model. The simulated patterns offer a very good match to the observed patterns for over 150 iterations of the model.},

  abstract = {As queer history is often hidden, historians must look for "signs" that hint at queer lives and experiences. When psychologists use projective tests, the search for queer signs has historically been more literal, and this was especially true in the homophobic practices of Psychology in the mid-twentieth century. In this paper, I respond to Elizabeth Scarborough's call for more analytic history about the lesser known women in Psychology's history. By focusing on British projective research conducted by lesbian psychologist June Hopkins, I shift perspective and consider, not those who were tested (which has been historically more common), but those who did the testing, and position them as potential queer subjects. After briefly outlining why the projective test movement is ripe for such analysis and the kinds of queer signs that were identified using the Rorschach ink blot test in the mid-twentieth century, I then present June Hopkins' (1969, 1970) research on the "lesbian personality." This work forms a framework upon which I then consider the lives of Margaret Lowenfeld, Ann Kaldegg, and Effie Lillian Hutton, all of whom were involved in the British projective test movement a generation prior to Hopkins. By adopting Hopkins' research to frame their lives, I present the possibility of this ambiguous history being distinctly queer.},

  abstract = {The genetic determinants of the organisation and variation of the flower, a striking feature of the angiosperms, are only beginning to be deciphered. Floral symmetry has recurrently evolved among angiosperms, zygomorphy (monosymmetry) being a key innovation due to its role in the plant-pollination interaction. As such, it represents a case study for evo-devo. Phylogenetic comparative studies conducted in two eudicot clades, the Ranunculales and the Asteridae sensu APGII, have shown that the evolution of this trait is dependent upon the architectural context of the flower. Genetic and developmental bases of zygomorphy have been investigated in several unrelated model species. In all these species, zygomorphy appears to be controlled, at least partially, by genes belonging to the TCP gene family of transcription factors and named CYC-like genes. Exploring the molecular bases of zygomorphy in non-model species spanning the diversity of angiosperms, but also the developmental processes involved, are now essential to understand the evolution of floral symmetry.},

  abstract = {The selection and validation of proper distinguishing characters are of crucial importance in taxonomic revisions. The modern classifications of orchids utilize the molecular tools, but still the selection and identification of the material used in these studies is for the most part related to general species morphology. One of the vegetative characters quoted in orchid manuals is leaf arrangement. However, phyllotactic diversity and ontogenetic changeability have not been analysed in detail in reference to particular taxonomic groups. Therefore, we evaluated the usefulness of leaf arrangements in the taxonomy of the genus Epipactis Zinn, 1757. Typical leaf arrangements in shoots of this genus are described as distichous or spiral. However, in the course of field research and screening of herbarium materials, we indisputably disproved the presence of distichous phyllotaxis in the species Epipactis purpurata Sm. and confirmed the spiral Fibonacci pattern as the dominant leaf arrangement. In addition, detailed analyses revealed the presence of atypical decussate phyllotaxis in this species, as well as demonstrated the ontogenetic formation of pseudowhorls. These findings confirm ontogenetic variability and plasticity in E. purpurata. Our results are discussed in the context of their significance in delimitations of complex taxa within the genus Epipactis.},

  abstract = {This article deals with a theorem at the basis of descriptive phyllotaxis, and with an explanatory approach in causal phyllotaxis. The theorem establishes the relation between the divergence angle and the visible opposed spiral pairs observed in structures such as proteins, meristematic apices, and the surfaces of plants. The lack of such a theorem has been an important source of errors, confusions, and obstructions in the mathematical approaches as well as in the biological interpretation of phyllotaxis. An elementary though not simple proof of it is given here together with an intuitive, less technical presentation. Many applications are mentioned. It is shown that the theorem gives a new meaning to Bolle's theory of bifurcated induction lines, which in turns throws new light on what is called the hierarchical representation of phyllotaxis. An explenatory model of phyllotaxis, in which the theorem plays an important role, is constructed in this representation. The idea of entropy, on which the model is based, is seen to constitute a most fundamental approach to phyllotactic systems.},

  abstract = {Pot cultures of cotton plants of Deltapine 15 in the stage of buding or the beginning of flowering were used as experimental material. The leaf arrangement of this plant in the form of 3/8 phyllotaxis can be reduced into a scheme shown in figure 2. In this diagram, the numerical numbers around the circumference may also represent the successive fruiting branches along the main stem, since the arrangement of the latter bears a constant relation to that of successive leaves themselves. However, since the fruiting branch is inserted, not in the center, but in the lateral side of the axil of leaf, there is a slight displacement in the relative position of the fruiting branch with respect to leaf base within the same node. And also because this displacement is always toward the right side of the axil in plant of clockwise spiral and toward the left side in plants of counterclockwise spiral, any given first leaf (indicated by "△" in the diagram) thus invariably takes a position between the fruiting branches 1 and 6, irrespective of the direction of spiral course. Now, if a line is drawn from this first leaf across the center of the circumference, we will have the different fruiting branches arranged with respect to that leaf in the following way: fruiting branches No. 1, 9, 6, 4, 3 are on the same side of the stem as the first leaf, No. 2, 5 on the opposite side, and No. 7, 8 in the intermediate positions. Our results of the study of the translocation of labelled assimilates are in full accordance with the above topographical relation between the leaves of main stem and the fruiting branches. The tracer experiments were carried out as previously described (Ting et al. 1960). After feeding a particular single leaf of main stem with C\textasciitilde (14)O\_2, the distribution of radioactive carbon in various reproductive organs and the terminal parts of the different fruiting branches of the plant was determined, and the relative specific activity was expressed as counts per minute per 100 mg of dry sample. The results so far obtained indicate that the translocation and distribution of assimilates from the leaves of main stem to the fruiting branches follow a definite course, referable to the above diagram if the treated leaf is designated as the first leaf. Thus, the labelled assimilates was found to be transported mostly to the branches No. 1, 9, 6,4and 3, to a lesser extent to the branches: No. 7 and 8, and almost nothing at all to the branches No. 2 and 5 which were exactly Opposite to the feeding leaf. Even when the samples were taken at a time up to 120 hours after the feeding, or when all other parts of the plant were cut away, retaining only the fruiting branches 2 and 5 before feeding, there was still no apparent increase in the amount of radioactive substances present in the branches 2 and 5. In short, the experimental results indicated that there exists a clear and definite regularity in the translocation and distribution of assimilates of the leaves of main stem in cotton plant. This well defined pattern of distribution is intimately linked to the arrangement of leaves and branches on the stem, and is also closely related to the patterning and interconnexion of vascular bundles within the plant.}

This is a complete model of phyllotaxis, integrating the author's interpretative model for generating spiral patterns. The paper underlines that a better understanding of the variety of phyllotactic patterns, and of the transitions between them, involves a phylogenetic perspective. It stresses the working hypothesis that spiral patterns are primitive and that all other patterns, such as whorled systems, are by-products of evolution from spirality. An important epistemological consequence on mathematical modelling is drawn out of this hypothesis, namely that models of knowledge or interpretative models, able to take care of the spiral patterns, must be formulated and then followed by simulation, mechanistic or conceptual models that are able to reproduce the transitions to all other types of patterns.},

  abstract = {Primary stem vasculature was investigated in seven genera and 69 species of the Cotyledonoideae, Kalanchoideae and Sedoideae. Vascular patterns in whole cleared stems were determined by number of leaf traces per leaf, number of leaf-trace sympodia per stem, and connections between traces and sympodia. Four patterns were found in the Cotyledonoideae, eight in the Kalanchoideae and four in the Sedoideae. Similarities and differences among the patterns are discussed and possible phylogenetic trends are suggested. Changes in vasculature during ontogeny were observed in the Kalanchoideae and related to patterns found in mature stems. Many species in all three subfamilies reveal a relationship between phyllotaxy, number of sympodia per stem, and the intervals at which leaf traces are connected to each sympodium. Patterns of vasculature were found to support many of the intergeneric relationships suggested by other studies of this family.},

To characterize the degree of order in phyllotactic systems, we determine the variation of the angle of divergence of a given leaf with regard to the preceding one. By knowing the range of uncertainty of the angle of divergence, it is possible to determine from which leaves rank a system becomes completely disorganized. We show that there is a quantitative link between the degree of uncertainty of the angle of divergence, and the number of regularly and randomly distributed leaves. To quantify this relationship, we deduced a formula from numerical simulations involving different ranges of uncertainty that can be observed in the angle of divergence in three different phyllotactic patterns: distichous (two orthostichies), opposite-decussate (four orthostichies) and spiral (137°). A χ2 statistical test allows us to determine the threshold of transition between ordered and disordered phyllotactic patterns with a fixed level ...},

We developed equations allowing the theoretical estimation of the number of leaves regularly distributed (spiral or verticillate) in a partially random phyllotactic system. The equations are simple and accurate enough to make quantitative predictions concerning the organization of different phyllotactic patterns (verticillate, distichous, spiral and random). This method can bring out patterns that are not visible a priori on a planar representation of the shoot apex. As a case study, the method was applied to the quantitative analysis of the sho mutants recently produced by Itoh et al. [2000. SHOOT ORGANIZATION genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in Rice. Plant Cell 12, 2161-2174].

Archaeological findings show that the American Indians were the first to cultivate sunflower in 4625 B.C. Sunflower is used in the diet, for oil, to obtain colors, for medical purposes, and as an ornamental plant. Sunflower is mostly used for oil production from seed, but it is also used as a protein crop for human consumption, as well as for feed. Depending on the breeding goals and final use, there are three basic sunflower types: oilseed, confectionery, and ornamental sunflower. Sunflower breeding has gone through three phases, depending on the breeding method that was predominantly used. These are mass selection, method of individual selection for development of varieties, and method for development of the hybrids. The genotypes for all three directions of breeding must meet certain common criteria in terms of flower appearance.},

Auxin patterning in the shoot apical meristem is in turn brought about by the subcellular polar distribution of the putative auxin efflux mediator, PIN1. However, the question of what signals determine PIN1 polarization and how this gives rise to regular patterns of auxin concentration remains unknown. Here we address these questions by using mathematical modeling combined with confocal imaging. We propose a model that is based on the assumption that auxin influences the polarization of its own efflux within the meristem epidermis. We show that such a model is sufficient to create regular spatial patterns of auxin concentration on systems with static and dynamic cellular connectivities, the latter governed by a mechanical model. We also optimize parameter values for the PIN1 dynamics by using a detailed auxin transport model, for which parameter values are taken from experimental estimates, together with a template consisting of cell and wall compartments as well as PIN1 concentrations quantitatively extracted from confocal data. The model shows how polarized transport can drive the formation of regular patterns.},

  abstract = {The pineapple exhibits the spiral ty?\textasciicircum{} °f phyllotaxy in regard to both the leaves and flowers. Miles Thomas \& Holmes (1930) from a study of angular distance between leaf primordia of seedling pineapple plants stated that the phyllotaxy was 11/18. In this system of expressing the phyllotaxy of a plant the numerator of the fraction indicates the number of spiral turns about the axis and the denominator the number of leaves in this spiral until one is vertically above another and older leaf in its attachment to the stem. We, however, have not been able to confirm these authors' findings in the phyllotaxy of the more nearly mature plant. The leaves were removed from a number of normal plants and a vertical line inscribed on the axis beginning at one of these dormant buds near the butt end of the main stem. It was noticed that this line with great regularity bisected the 14th and 27th buds. This indicated an interval of thirteen buds before another appeared vertically above bud number one. Tracing the buds around from Nos. I to 14 there were five complete turns about the axis. These findings therefore establish the leaf phyllotaxy as 5/13. The deviation to the right or left in right and left spiral plants of the 14th and 27th buds from the vertical line is possibly due to a slight torsion of the axis during growth. This explanation for these deviations appears more plausible from the fact that in each case the deviation was in the same direction as the leaf spiral. Preliminary observations of the leaf arrangement on the pineapple plant stem were made by Sideris (1926) in the course of studies of the fibrovascular system of the plant. While he did not state what type of phyllotaxy was present it was clear from his analysis of the fibrovascular system of the stem and successive leaves that the 5/13 t5rpe was present. Priestley et al. (1935) have studied in detail the phyUotaxy of a monocotyledon in relation to the internal arrangement of the fibroDevelopmental Studies of the Pineapple 315 vascular system and the origin of new leaves at the meristem area. They discuss the possibility of a transition from a simple type of phyUotaxy to a more complex one, as being the logical result of an increase in the size of the meristem area. We have shown in the pineapple that such a change is the first visible evidence of the formation of the inflorescence, which we show has a phyUotaxy one degree more complex than the phyUotaxy of the stem bearing only leaves. The phyUotaxy of the inflorescence has been found by Dr M. B. Linford of this Station (unpubhshed data) to be of the 8/21 type and is thus different from that of the leaves on the same plant. Plants of the Cayenne variety were found to have either right- or left-hand spirals and the fruits were of the same type as the main stem of the plant. Whether the shoots produced by a plant have right- or left-hand spirals appears to be a matter of chance, depending on whether the second leaf primordium develops on the right or the left side of the initial primordium. The investigation concerning phyUotaxy has been carried on using the Cayenne variety. An examination of pineapples growing in the variety garden has shown that the large fruited varieties. Queen, Taboga, Pernambuco and Wild Kailua, have the same phyUotaxy as Cayenne. The smaUer fruited pineapples. Ananas microstachys Lindm. and A. microcephalus (Bak.) Bertoni, have a fruit phyUotaxis of 5/13 and a phyllotaxis of 3/8 for the plant. The phyUotaxy of the pineapple is not, however, a fixed genetic character but appears to be dependent upon the size or area of the meristem at the growing point. We have already shown that the meristem area increases in size as the first visible steps in formation of the inflorescence. Later the senior author found that acetylene was equaUy efficient in forcing flowering. Using the latter gas, Cayenne plants of different ages have been forced to flower and form fruits. It was found that smaU plants up to 2 months of age when treated 3i6 K. R. KERNS, J. L. COLLINS AND H . KIM produced fruits having the 5/13 fruit phyllotaxy, but that plants treated when 4 months of age or older produced fruits having the normal 8/21 phyllotaxy. We have called attention to the increase in the size of the meristem area preceding the development of the inflorescence and a reduction at the completion of flower formation and beginning of the crown development. These two transitional zones are marked in the mature inflorescence and fruit by a series of small short leaves, the involucral bracts at the base of the fruit and sterile bracts at the top between the fruit and the crown. These leaves mark the transition from a 5/13 phyllotaxy to the 8/21 phyllotaxy of the fruit and back again to the 5/13. The first change, we beheve, is quite abrupt and rapid but the second one much less so. These two periods may be looked upon as critical ones in the development of fruits. Abnormalities of fruit and crown development such as double monsters, fasciations and multiple crowns may be the results of interference with the regular transition from one to the other of these regular systems of pbyllotaxy. Multiple crowns may be the result of tbe failure of the meristem area to return completely to the 5/13 type following the 8/21 type of the fruit. The normal phyllotaxy of the plant and fruit appears to rest upon a co-ordinated space relationship in the meristem area. It is quite probable that chemical and physiological factors play an important role in bringing about these size changes in the meristem, but we are not at this time attempting to visualize their place in these phenomena.

  abstract = {Although genetic control of morphogenesis is well established, elaboration of complex shapes requires changes in the mechanical properties of cells. In plants, the first visible sign of leaf formation is a bulge on the flank of the shoot apical meristem. Bulging results from local relaxation of cell walls, which causes them to yield to internal hydrostatic pressure. By manipulation of tissue tension in combination with quantitative live imaging and finite-element modeling, we found that the slow-growing area at the shoot tip is substantially strain-stiffened compared with surrounding fast-growing tissue. We propose that strain stiffening limits growth, restricts organ bulging, and contributes to the meristem's functional zonation. Thus, mechanical signals are not just passive readouts of gene action but feed back on morphogenesis.},

  abstract = {Merosity, indicating the basic number of floral organs such as sepals and petals, has been constrained to specific and stable numbers during the evolution of angiosperms. The ancestral flower is considered to have a spiral arrangement of perianth organs, as in phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves. How has the ancestral spiral evolved into flowers with specific merosities? To address this question, we studied perianth organ arrangement in the Anemone genus of the basal eudicot family Ranunculaceae, because various merosities are found in this genus. In three species, A. flaccida, A. scabiosa, and A. nikoensis that are normally pentamerous, we found positional arrangement of the excessive sixth perianth organ indicating the possibility of a transition from pentamerous to trimerous arrangement. Arrangement was intraspecifically stochastic, but constrained to three of five types, where trimerous arrangement was the most frequent in all species except for a form of A. scabiosa. The rank of frequency of the other two types was species-dependent. We connect these observations with classical theories of spiral phyllotaxis. The phyllotaxis model for initiation of the sixth organ showed that the three arrangements occur at a divergence angle {$<$}144°, indicating the spiral nature of floral phyllotaxis rather than a perfect penta-radial symmetry of 144°. The model further showed that selective occurrence of trimerous arrangement is mainly regulated by the organ growth rate. Differential organ growth as well as divergence angle may regulate transitions between pentamerous and trimerous flowers in intraspecific variation as well as in species evolution.},

METHODS: Data were collected on the direction of midrib curvature and leaf coil in Syngonium podophyllum, the location of floral buds in Acalypha virginica, the position of secondary leaves of Croton variegatus 'Banana' and the relative size of half-lamina in Aglaonema crispum and Calathea ornata. KEY RESULTS: All five features were exclusively anodic with respect to the direction of the genetic spiral regardless of whether the spiral was clockwise or counterclockwise. CONCLUSIONS: Any phyllotactic mechanism must include some asymmetric component which cannot be explained by the prevalent hypotheses of contact parastichies, inhibitory fields, available space, pressure waves and auxin transport. The most favourable hypothesis is the primary vasculature explanation as it includes an asymmetric feature.},

Extensive literature focuses on the linear stability analysis of homogeneous equilibria in these systems, culminating in a set of conditions for transport-driven instabilities that are commonly presumed to initiate self-organisation. We demonstrate that a selection of simple, canonical transport models with only mild multistable non-linearities can satisfy the Turing instability conditions while also robustly exhibiting only transient patterns. Hence, a Turing-like instability is insufficient for the existence of a patterned state. While it is known that linear theory can fail to predict the formation of patterns, we demonstrate that such failures can appear robustly in systems with multiple stable homogeneous equilibria. Given that biological systems such as gene regulatory networks and spatially distributed ecosystems often exhibit a high degree of multistability and nonlinearity, this raises important questions of how to analyse prospective mechanisms for self-organisation.},

This allows a new type of diagram to be drawn in which a two-dimensional k′1k′4 space is divided by Turing's conditions into regions where the various morphogenetic behaviours occur. An analysis using this type of diagram is applied to the linear limit of two non-linear models, those of Gierer and Meinhardt and of Tyson's modification of the Brusselator, and is used to clarify what is happening in their non-linear development. Several possible applications are mentioned; to the stability of a simple binary pattern in slime moulds, to the development and decay of a succession of patterns in the imaginal wing discs of Drosophila as treated by Kauffman et al., and to the apparent ease of disturbing the sea urchin blastula to produce a three-part, rather than a two-part pattern.},

  abstract = {Using the plant model Arabidopsis, the relationship between day length, the size of the shoot apical meristem, and the robustness of phyllotactic patterns were analysed. First, it was found that reducing day length leads to an increased meristem size and an increased number of alterations in the final positions of organs along the stem. Most of the phyllotactic defects could be related to an altered tempo of organ emergence, while not affecting the spatial positions of organ initiations at the meristem. A correlation was also found between meristem size and the robustness of phyllotaxis in two accessions (Col-0 and WS-4) and a mutant (clasp-1), independent of growth conditions. A reduced meristem size in clasp-1 was even associated with an increased robustness of the phyllotactic pattern, beyond what is observed in the wild type. Interestingly it was also possible to modulate the robustness of phyllotaxis in these different genotypes by changing day length. To conclude, it is shown first that robustness of the phyllotactic pattern is not maximal in the wild type, suggesting that, beyond its apparent stereotypical order, the robustness of phyllotaxis is regulated. Secondly, a role for day length in the robustness of the phyllotaxis was also identified, thus providing a new example of a link between patterning and environment in plants. Thirdly, the experimental results validate previous model predictions suggesting a contribution of meristem size in the robustness of phyllotaxis via the coupling between the temporal sequence and spatial pattern of organ initiations.},

The manner in which the vascular system was reoriented during these phyllotactic transitions was determined by anatomical analysis of serial microsections, whereas the positions of the transitions were determined by 14C labeling. The midvein at the tip of leaves representing plants of different PI and leaves of different Leaf Plastochron Index (LPI) was fed 14CO2 photosynthetically, and primordia LPI 0 through LPI-9 were dissected from the buds and analyzed for 14C. By combining the labeling data with the anatomical observations it was possible to reconstruct the vascular system of a plant of PI 16 and to locate the phyllotactic transitions. Both the anatomical and the labeling data showed a high degree of reproducibility among plants suggesting that the phyllotactic pattern to which the vascular system conforms may be programmed in the plant and transmitted acropetally through the developing leaves and procambial strands. The origin of new primordia and the concepts of orthostichy, ontogenetic helix, and Fibonacci sequence are discussed as they apply to the vascular system of P. deltoides.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Approximately one-third of the \emph{c}. 1200 polycystine radiolarian names currently recognized as valid in deep-sea research (Cenozoic sediments and plankton) come from the first century of taxonomic studies (\emph{c}. 1840–1930). German scientists dominated early research on radiolarian biology and taxonomy. C. G. Ehrenberg’s initial work was followed by E. Haeckel’s mammoth monographic works, particularly his \emph{Challenger} report. Other important early workers were D. Rüst on Mesozoic and Palaeozoic forms and A. Popofsky on plankton and sediment materials, with smaller contributions by J. Müller, E. Stöhr, F. Dreyer and H. Mast. Excluding Haeckel, these workers together published over 2000 species names. A fraction (5–25\%) of these names are still used today in deep-sea research, with a tendency for more prolific authors to have higher modern usage rates. Haeckel’s legacy is different. He published over 5000 species names, but only a few percent are still used. The reasons for his species names no longer being used seem to include both factors common to disuse of names from other early authors (inadequate text descriptions, poor or absent illustration, no preserved original materials) but also due to substantial duplication of species and genus names, created by imposition of a partially artificial high level taxonomy. Based on Haeckel’s own writings and by analogy to other parts of Haeckel’s work, it is suggested that Haeckel’s desire to discover and show evolutionary relationships lay behind this flawed approach to taxonomy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Green plants (Viridiplantae) include around 450,000–500,000 species1,2 of great diversity and have important roles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life.},

Architecture is generated after embryogenesis through the activities of shoot apical meristems and root apical meristems. Leaves are the principal lateral organ that determines the plant shoot morphology, and they normally develop in very regular patterns in time and space. The spatial pattern of leaf arrangement is called phyllotaxy, and the temporal pattern is determined by the plastochron, which is the time between successive leaf initiation events. Both programs involve many gene activities as well as the hormones auxin and cytokinin. Apparently, the mechanisms controlling phyllotaxy and plastochron share some regulatory components. In this review, the molecular mechanisms for both patterning programs will be discussed.},

  abstract = {About two-thirds of the more than 100 genera in the Araceae lack tepals and their absence is considered derived. Unlike most of these atepalate genera, Calla palustris has about twice as many stamens per flower. Using epi-illumination microscopy, we studied floral development in Calla to see if the supernumerary stamens form in positions corresponding to tepal positions in perigonate Araceae. If so, this would be an example of homeosis--in this case, the replacement of tepals with stamens--in the evolution of this genus. We found the positions of stamen primordia in many floral buds too irregular to conclude that they replace tepals positionally. However, in more regular floral buds the first formed stamens do form in what correspond to tepal sites in related genera. If the immediate ancestor to Calla had tepals, as is generally assumed, stamen positions in the more regular flowers, at least, support a homeotic interpretation. There is no evidence that the supernumerary stamens arise by dedoublement, but since morphogenesis in Calla is only partly comparable to other aroids, and the phylogeny in the family is not well understood, further studies are needed to resolve the interpretation of the flower in Calla. With regard to systematics and evolution, the absence of tepals in Calla may not be homologous with atepaly in other members of the family, as has been assumed for the past century.},

In order to make wise use of existing resources, researchers now find themselves committed to carrying out this vision with its accompanying assumptions. By clarifying the specific characteristics of model organism work, we aim to provide a framework to assess how much funding should be allocated to such research. On the one hand, it is imperative to exploit the resources and knowledge accumulated using these models to study more diverse groups of organisms. On the other hand, this type of research may be inappropriate for research programmes where the processes of interest are much more delimited, can be usefully studied in isolation and/or are simply not captured by model organism biology.},

The differentation of the flower heads of the Compositae appeared to be a close imitation of the evolutionary sequence of solitary flowers. The long-debated »mystery» of the development of »pseudoflower» from the multi-flowered inflorescences of the Compositae was plausibly explained by the behaviour of plant pollinators.

  abstract = {In plants and parenchymatous brown algae the body arises through the activity of an apical meristem (a niche of cells or a single cell). The meristem produces lateral organs in specific patterns, referred to as phyllotaxis. In plants, two different control mechanisms have been proposed: one is position-dependent and relies on morphogen accumulation at future organ sites; the other is a lineage-based system which links phyllotaxis to the apical cell division pattern. Here we examine the apical patterning of the brown alga, Sargassum muticum, which exhibits spiral phyllotaxis (137.5° angle) and an unlinked apical cell division pattern. The Sargassum apex presents characteristics of a self-organising system, similar to plant meristems. In contrast to complex plant meristems, we were unable to correlate the plant morphogen auxin with bud positioning in Sargassum, nor could we predict cell wall softening at new bud sites. Our data suggests that in Sargassum muticum there is no connection between phyllotaxis and the apical cell division pattern indicating a position-dependent patterning mechanism may be in place. The underlying mechanisms behind the phyllotactic patterning appear to be distinct from those seen in plants.},

In addition, we propose an ontogenetic scale that integrates the results of the present work to that of previous studies on sunflower reproductive development.

  abstract = {Embryogenesis is a critical developmental process that establishes the body organization of higher plants. During this process, the biogenesis of chloroplasts from proplastids is essential. A failure in chloroplast development during embryogenesis can cause morphologically abnormal embryos or embryonic lethality. In this study, we isolated a T-DNA insertion mutant of the Arabidopsis gene EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2726 (EMB2726). Heterozygous emb2726 seedlings produced about 25\% albino seeds with embryos that displayed defects at the 32-cell stage and that arrested development at the late globular stage. EMB2726 protein was localized in chloroplasts and was expressed at all stages of development, such as embryogenesis. Moreover, the two translation elongation factor Ts domains within the protein were critical for its function. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cells in emb2726 embryos contained undifferentiated proplastids and that the expression of plastid genome-encoded photosynthesis-related genes was dramatically reduced. Expression studies of DR5:GFP, pDRN:DRN-GFP, and pPIN1:PIN1-GFP reporter lines indicated normal auxin biosynthesis but altered polar auxin transport. The expression of pSHR:SHR-GFP and pSCR:SCR-GFP confirmed that procambium and ground tissue precursors were lacking in emb2726 embryos. The results suggest that EMB2726 plays a critical role during Arabidopsis embryogenesis by affecting chloroplast development, possibly by affecting the translation process in plastids.},

Under proper geometrical constraints, the patterns developed through self-assembly in order to minimize the total strain energy.

  journaltitle = {PLoS ONE},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0200601},
  abstract = {The golden ratio, ϕ = 1.61803…, has often been found in connection with biological phenomena, ranging from spirals in sunflowers to gene frequency. One example where the golden ratio often arises is in self-replication, having its mathematical origins in Fibonacci’s sequence for “rabbit reproduction”. Recently, it has been claimed that ϕ determines the ratio between the number of different nucleobases in human genome. Such empirical examples continue to give credence to the idea that the golden ratio is a universal constant, not only in mathematics but also for biology. In this paper, we employ a general framework for chemically realistic self-replicating reaction systems and investigate whether the ratio of chemical species population follows “universal constants”. We find that many self-replicating systems can be characterised by an algebraic number, which, in some cases, is the golden ratio. However, many other algebraic numbers arise from these systems, and some of them—such as 2 3 = 1 . 25992 … and 1.22074… which is also known as the 3rd lower golden ratio—arise more frequently in self-replicating systems than the golden ratio. The “universal constants” in these systems arise as roots of a limited number of distinct characteristic equations. In addition, these “universal constants” are transient behaviours of self-replicating systems, corresponding to the scenario that the resource inside the system is infinite, which is not always the case in practice. Therefore, we argue that the golden ratio should not be considered as a special universal constant in self-replicating systems, and that the ratios between different chemical species only go to certain numbers under some idealised scenarios.},

This we also find in the Euclidian geometry when performing the Golden Section and by deriving the Golden or Devine Number in golden rectangles, spirals and the Golden Angle. The Golden Section is considered as most beautiful and used in architecture and art. It is found everywhere in nature, e.g. in the pentagram of flowers, in the spirals of the shells of snails and Nautilus and even in galaxies of space. The Golden Angle in plants is realized in the phyllotaxis of spirals of leaf rosettes, in fruit stands and in the cones of conifers and cycads. It optimizes packing of modules such as seeds and fruits as well as the capture of light by leaves for photosynthesis and the fitness of productivity. Although we can mathematically deduce it and scientifically explain its role in organization and formation of patterns of structure and function, we cannot explain why we find it beautiful. In a methodological dualism esthetics and beauty are transcendental categories besides science. Or are the pleasant sensations of the Golden Section elicited by different stimuli to which our brain is adapted? Perhaps the Golden Section found everywhere in the entire universe is a link between natural science and the transcendental dimension, while a flower of a rose remains both a complex scientific system and an object of overwhelming beauty.},

@online{macbaGrowthForm2014,
  title = {Growth and {{Form}}},
  author = {MACBA},
  date = {2014},
  abstract = {Growth and Form was an exhibition produced by Richard Hamilton at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London, in 1951, in the context of the Festival of Britain. It consisted of a large-scale installation – reconstructed in 2014 at Tate Modern, London, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid – that was inspired by the book of Scottish mathematician and biologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson, On Growth and Form (1917). Hamilton brought together a range of scientific and organic materials, using the most innovative and imaginative technologies of the moment. One of the effects of this exhibition was, as Hamilton wrote, the influence it may have upon design trends'. The book that inspired Hamilton, a scientific study on animal morphology that had been given to him by his friend, artist and photographer Nigel Henderson, created a deep impression on him. ‘I had begun to feel that exhibition was an art form in its own right. The exhibits were subsidiary to the way they were treated.’ Growth and Form was the first and most emblematic of a series of exhibitions produced by Hamilton in the fifties: Parallel of Life and Art (1953), Man, Machine \& Motion (1955), House of the Future (1956) and This is Tomorrow (1956). At that time, there was an old-fashioned approach to exhibition practice in England in academic contexts. Hence the interest of Hamilton, linked to the Independent Group (a forward-thinking group whose discussions in the fifties brought together architects, writers and painters), in radically rethinking the format and the very idea of exhibition practice. This exhibition, inspired by the sensitivity and strategies of Surrealism and Dada, Joyce’s literary techniques and Duchamp, helped Hamilton develop his own exhibition language. His visual references were also determined by the discovery of György Kepes, László Moholy-Nagy and Sigfried Giedion. These readings favoured revitalising the social function of art and bringing together artistic and scientific experimentation, at a time when technology was developing a new visual order. Hamilton saw a clear need for an exhibition practice based on the principles of visualisation and the ability to incorporate contemporary technology. To all these ideas we should add his technical training in design. Growth and Form is based on studies in biology and morphology. The newsletter of the ICA dated 28 December 1949 explained in respect of Hamilton’s exhibition: ‘Modern science has put at the disposal of artists and industrial designers a rich universe of new forms and discovered for them a new source of inspiration. Due to the schism between science and art, sufficient attention has still not been given to this material and its potentially revolutionary importance for modern design.’ Emphasis was put on the visual experience of the exhibition: art can expand its experiential universe if it is able to appreciate natural forms through scientific studies. Conceived as an installation combining several techniques, the exhibition consisted of three sculptural objects: a large structure resembling a lens with bones (one of them had mirrors showing the curvature of the refraction); a lattice structure with three-dimensional objects (based on the drawings of morphologies in Thompson’s book) and panels of images; and an independent cell structure. In the vitrines were exhibited objects and maquettes: a horse’s skull, the vertebrae of a goat and some eggs, among other things. On one wall was a large X-ray of the flipper of a seal; in another, a row of illuminated glass negatives, photomicrographs, X-rays, film frames and other items. Two films were also projected: one, on the ceiling, showing images of the formation of a crystal, and the other, on a table, the development of the cell of a sea urchin. There were other mobile maquettes illustrating mathematical form. Another maquette displayed the changes in form experienced when a drop of water falls and electronic flash equipment helped to reproduce the form of a spray. The changing combinations of different elements and structures suggested multiple visions to the visitors: cellular structures combined with exhibits in the form of grid and projected images of living processes. The background to this was a desire to close the debate that had emerged in the late forties, in the field of design and architecture, between the functionalism of Le Corbusier – defender of the grid and rational planning – and supporters of a new humanism,who proposed a form of urban planning with human associations. In the midst of this debate, Hamilton chose to superimpose irregular, organic forms with the geometry of the grid. With lyrical images close to Surrealism, Growth and Form was a conceptual and aesthetic success. A review in The Sunday Times read: ‘An enthroned octopus sits on the sofa of its own tentacles; skeletons climb the apparatus of a tiny gym and, thanks to the ingenuity of science, we leave the exhibition convinced that we have seen infinity in a jellyfish and eternity in the power of a goat.’}

  abstract = {A morphodynamic model for phyllotaxis based upon an axiomatic approach is presented. We show that the helical forms of alternate phyllotaxis can be derived from the assumption of the rudiment's growth and movement on the cylindrical embryo surface in the absence of a longitudinal displacement. This leads to the repeating transition of tetragonal packaging of the rudiments into hexagonal packaging and vice versa. Under these conditions, sequences of rudiments produce either left-handed or right-handed helices, the number of which at the circumference of the cylinder corresponds to adjacent numbers of the Fibonacci series. Cross-opposite phyllotaxis forms are defined as superior with respect to the alternate ones, and verticillate phyllotaxis forms as superior with respect to the cross-opposite ones. Different phyllotaxis forms can be interpreted as a result of stretching of crystalline structures of the embryo formed by dense packing of rudiments. The superior phyllotaxis forms can be considered as the additive summation of lower forms. Morphodynamic mechanisms underlying the formation of multiple forms of helical phyllotaxis are discussed.}

During the strictly vegetative phase, lasting for 6-7 days from sowing, mitotic divisions were confined to the peripheral zone, while the central mother cells zone proper, together with the distal cells positioned above the mother zone and also the central portion of the tunica, were relatively quiescent. Mitotic activity increased in the distal cells zone on day 8 and reached the level of that in the peripheral zone by day 12. This was accompanied by an enlargement of this zone and the consequent recession of the mother zone away from the central tunica. At the same time there was a substantial increase in the amount of cytoplasm in the cells of the central tunica. Mitotic activity in the central tunica began on day 12 and reached a peak on day 16. This zone then lost its distinct entity and was replaced by a uniform dome-shaped meristematic layer that became apparent by day 16. The cells of the mother zone remained quiescent during the transition period.},

  abstract = {The photoperiodic sensitivity of two “early” oilseed sunflower cultivars, (Helianthus annuus L.), Sunfola 68-2 and HA-124, was assessed by determining the time for flower initiation to progress through a sequence of 10 floral stages, defined by reference to scanning electron microscope photographs of fixed stem apices. It was found for plants maintained in controlled environments with daylengths of 11 or 18 h that there was no significant difference in the time of flower initiation in either cultivar, although post-initiation development of the primordial inflorescence was faster in the 11 h short day leading to an earlier anthesis. It is concluded that post-initiation sensitivity to daylength may account for some of the variation in the time of anthesis and the “head visible” stage, reported for Sunfola 68-2 and other cultivars and hybrids.},

  abstract = {The mitotic cycle in the apical meristem of Helianthus annuus L. has been investigated during the transition to flowering. Towards the end of the strictly vegetative phase 8 days after sowing the average cell-cycle time, measured by colchicine-induced metaphase accumulation, was 37 hr in the peripheral zone, 83 hr in the central zone and 118 hr in the rib meristem. By Day 12 the cycle had shortened in all zones. By the time of floral initiation on Day 16 the cycle time had returned to its original value in the peripheral zone and the rib meristem, while in the central zone it continued to shorten to 33 hr, approaching the cycle time of the peripheral zone. Cytophotometric measurements of nuclear DNA showed that mitotic activation of the central zone was not associated with any reduction in the proportion of nuclei with a 4 C DNA content. It was calculated that the spatial and temporal variation in cell-cycle time was mainly a function of the length of the G\textsubscript{1}/G\textsubscript{0} phase which lasted about 19 hr in the peripheral zone, 82 hr in the rib meristem, and declined from 55 to 21 hr in the central zone.},

It was perceived as a form of linguistic conventionalism and thus taken to rely on the bankrupt notion of truth by convention. However, recent scholarship has revealed a more subtle picture. It has been forcefully argued that Carnap is not a linguistic conventionalist in any straightforward sense, and that supposedly decisive objections against his position target a straw man. This raises two questions. First, how exactly should we characterise Carnap's actual philosophy of mathematics? Secondly, is his position an attractive alternative to established views? I will tackle these issues by looking at Carnap's response to the incompleteness theorems. Drawing on arguments put forward by Gödel and Beth, I show that some crucial aspects of Carnap's positive account have remained underdeveloped. Suggestions on what a full evaluation of Carnap's position requires are made.},

The morphogen molecules are created, diffuse, and are destroyed, and these processes are modeled via a morphogen reaction-diffusion PDE. The morphogen molecules flow through the concentration field at a rate RM, which measures the distance of the system from thermodynamic equilibrium. The phyllotaxis system is considered to be a dissipative structure, far from equilibrium, maintained by the flow of morphogen molecules through it. The system entropy and the cycle-averaged rates at which entropy is added to the environment are examined numerically as functions of Δθ and RM. It is found that the naturally occurring divergence angles correspond to a maximum of entropy and a minimum of cycled-averaged entropy production rates. The entropy and entropy production rates increase monotonically with RM.},

A theorem of Swierczkowski concerning the intervals between adjacent points placed on a circle according to the divergence angle 137·5° is generalized to include the other angles encountered in phyllotaxis. These angles are characterized by having continued fraction expansions containing no intermediate fractions after a finite number of terms. This criterion is shown to be sufficient for uniform spacing of leaves. A morphogen concentration field established by the leaves acting as sources is determined principally by :he geometrical spacing of the leaves and hence by their divergence angle. It is shown that the mean square of such a concentration field, is a relative minimum if the leaves are positioned by means of one of the φG. Thornley's dynamic scheme for determining the phyllotaxis divergence angles by positioning a new leaf at the minimum of the concentration field of previously placed leaves is also shown to be related to the spacing properties of the φG.},

  abstract = {Preliminary studies establishing relationships between leaf plastochron index and Epilobium hirsutum L. shoot growth provide a method for rigorous selection of plants utilized in experiments designed to test the working hypothesis that endogenous auxin gradient interactions are factors of phyllotactic control in this species. Application of N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), an auxin transport inhibitor, to one of the youngest bijugate primordia on the shoot meristem results in increased growth of the treated primordium. Fasciation between the treated primordium and one of the next primordia to be initiated alters relative vertical spacing of primordia. Angular shifts between subsequent primordia result in spiral transformation of Epilobium bijugate phyllotaxy. Application of α-4-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (CPIB), an auxin antagonist, to one of the youngest bijugate primordia on the shoot meristem results in decreased growth of the treated primordium that alters both radial and vertical spacing of primordia. This is followed by angular shifts between subsequent primordia resulting in spiral transformation of the bijugate phyllotaxy. Changes in the growth parameters of NPA- and CPIB- treated shoots are similar. Relative plastochron rates of radial and vertical shoot growth of induced spiral shoots are about half those of lanolin paste control shoots, as are the plastochrons and relative plastochron rates of leaf elongation. Treated shoot meristems have eccentricities of 0.5 as compared to bijugate control meristem eccentricities of 0.7. No significant difference is apparent between basal transverse areas of treated and control shoot meristems. The relative chronological rates of growth of treated shoots are not significantly different from those rates of control shoots. Spiral transformation results from changes in relative positions of leaf primordia insertion on the shoot meristem, not from changes in growth of treated shoots. These changes are accompanied by an increased rate of leaf initiation on a more circular shoot meristem. Existing theoretical models of phyllotaxy are discussed in relation to these chemically induced changes of Epilobium leaf arrangement.},

  abstract = {Growth of Ranunculus shoots through ontogeny is quantified by techniques utilizing scanning electron microscopy and studies on living plant material The order of the contact parastichy phyllotaxy in the apical system is related to the relative plastochron rates of growth of the shoot. There is a change in the (2, 3) contact parastichy pattern of vegetative phyllotaxy to a transitional (3, 5) contact pattern which is maintained through sepal production. Formation of a 5(1, 1) whorl of petal primordia establishes a (5, 8) contact pattern with the sepal primordia. Subsequent initiation of stamen primordia, in spiral sequence, results in (5, 8, 13) triple contacts between petal and stamen primordia. The stamen primordia and carpel primordia arrangement is characterized by a (8, 13) contact parastichy pattern of phyllotaxy. Through ontogeny the volume of the shoot apex progressively increases but the shape of the apex, described by a second degree polynomial, remains constant The plastochron and the relative plastochron rates of radial and vertical displacement of primordia progressively decrease during transition but there is no alteration of the chronological rate of apical expansion. The change in contact parastichy phyllotaxy through ontogeny is interpreted as a change in the relative positions of primordia insertion on the apex resulting from an increase in apical volume and an increased rate of primordia initiation.},

Floral meristems (FM) produce floral organs, after which they undergo floral meristem termination (FMT), and precise control of organ initiation and FMT is crucial to reproductive success of any flowering plant. Using a live confocal imaging, we characterized developmental dynamics during floral organ primordia initiation and FMT in             Aquilegia coerulea             (Ranunculaceae). Our results have uncovered distinct patterns of primordium initiation between stamens and staminodes compared to carpels, and provided insight into the process of FMT, which is discernable based on cell division dynamics preceding carpel initiation. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative live imaging of meristem development in a system with numerous whorls of floral organs as well as an apocarpous gynoecium. This study provides crucial information for our understanding of how the spatial-temporal regulation of floral meristem behavior is achieved in both an evolutionary and developmental context.},

  abstract = {A striking feature of vascular plants is the regular arrangement of lateral organs on the stem, known as phyllotaxis. The most common phyllotactic patterns can be described using spirals, numbers from the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle. This rich mathematical structure, along with the experimental reproduction of phyllotactic spirals in physical systems, has led to a view of phyllotaxis focusing on regularity. However all organisms are affected by natural stochastic variability, raising questions about the effect of this variability on phyllotaxis and the achievement of such regular patterns. Here we address these questions theoretically using a dynamical system of interacting sources of inhibitory field. Previous work has shown that phyllotaxis can emerge deterministically from the self-organization of such sources and that inhibition is primarily mediated by the depletion of the plant hormone auxin through polarized transport. We incorporated stochasticity in the model and found three main classes of defects in spiral phyllotaxis--the reversal of the handedness of spirals, the concomitant initiation of organs and the occurrence of distichous angles--and we investigated whether a secondary inhibitory field filters out defects. Our results are consistent with available experimental data and yield a prediction of the main source of stochasticity during organogenesis. Our model can be related to cellular parameters and thus provides a framework for the analysis of phyllotactic mutants at both cellular and tissular levels. We propose that secondary fields associated with organogenesis, such as other biochemical signals or mechanical forces, are important for the robustness of phyllotaxis. More generally, our work sheds light on how a target pattern can be achieved within a noisy background.},

I have considered an inhibitory spacing mechanism at some length, as it is a plausible candidate. However, the same treatment would apply equally well to depletion of, or competition for, a compound by developing leaves, and could no doubt accommodate other ingredients.The mathematical principles involved are clear when it is assumed that only two leaves (the contacts) position a new leaf. There is some experimental evidence for this assumption. Nonetheless, it is not a precondition for Fibonacci phyllotaxis, since a computer model shows that this pattern is generated even when many leaves contribute to inhibition at a given point. Indeed, the Fibonacci pattern seems to be a robust and stable mathematical phenomenon, a finding which goes some way to explaining its widespread occurrence throughout the plant kingdom.},

  abstract = {Thesis (Ph. D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 2002."September 2002."Includes bibliographical references (v. 2, leaves 329-339).This study analyzes the intellectual and historical milieu of the Independent Group. Its point of departure is Growth and Form, an exhibition of scientific imagery, largely conceived and designed by Richard Hamilton, and the book accompanying the exhibition, Aspects of Form, edited by Lancelot Law Whyte and including a wide range of essays by leading scientists of the day, as well as by Konrad Lorenz, Rudolf Arnheim, and Ernst Gombrich. In tracing the discourses of "form" and "unity" to several distinct sources, my study charts the unmapped territory where multiple influential, yet previously unconnected art figures may be seen to cross paths. The models of perception posited by the writers discussed in this study-a Romantic organicism, a scientific and a scientistic unitarism, and the ostensibly empirical Gestalt theory-existed simultaneously and intermingled in the IG environment. The historical avant-garde's emphasis on method--such as El Lissitsky's call for "Gestaltung als Ergebnis wissenschaftlicher Untersuchung eines Problems," or Hannes Meyer's call for the "wissenschaftliche Erfassung und gestalterische Umsetzung der neuen Welt" --continued after World War II.(cont.) But while those radical experiments were at times themselves totalizing-wanting to reform society, politics, and housing right then and there-scientific method or, in Habermas' term, a notion of "procedural rationality," now served as a means of somehow 'neutralizing' politics from practices such as architecture, design, and painting. The artist's role became one not of agitator, planner, or social engineer but of medium or seismograph as Moholy-Nagy's wrote in the 1947 Vision in Motion. This intellectual framework led the IG to see in mass culture an art form that fulfilled all the concepts of unity their milieu had to offer: it practiced a unity of art and life, constituted direct communication (unhampered by emotive speech or extra-textual references), and it practiced a cultural monism in which all perceptions were equally valid. Accordingly, the assumption was, one could decide whether something was successful or not, but ethical and political judgments could be left out as metaphysical, elitist, or, simply, old-fashioned.by Isabelle Moffat.Ph.D.},

Computational analyses of these data enable the digitization and analysis of individual cells. In order to fully harness the information encoded within these datasets, annotation of the cell types within organs may be performed. This enables data points to be placed within the context of their position and identity, and for equivalent cell types to be compared between samples. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) in plants is the apical stem cell niche from which all above ground organs are derived. We developed 3DCellAtlas Meristem which enables the complete cellular annotation of all cells within the SAM with up to 96\% accuracy across all cell types in Arabidopsis and 99\% accuracy in tomato SAMs. Successive layers of cells are identified along with the central stem cells, boundary regions, and layers within developing primordia. Geometric analyses provide insight into the morphogenetic process that occurs during these developmental processes. Coupling these digital analyses with reporter expression will enable multidimensional analyses to be performed at single cell resolution. This provides a rapid and robust means to perform comprehensive cellular annotation of plant SAMs and digital single cell analyses, including cell geometry and gene expression. This fills a key gap in our ability to analyse and understand complex multicellular biology in the apical plant stem cell niche and paves the way for digital cellular atlases and analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shoot branching is an important determinant of plant architecture and influences various aspects of growth and development. Selection on branching has also played an important role in the domestication of crop plants, including sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Here, we describe an investigation of the genetic basis of variation in branching in sunflower via association mapping in a diverse collection of cultivated sunflower lines. RESULTS: Detailed phenotypic analyses revealed extensive variation in the extent and type of branching within the focal population. After correcting for population structure and kinship, association analyses were performed using a genome-wide collection of SNPs to identify genomic regions that influence a variety of branching-related traits. This work resulted in the identification of multiple previously unidentified genomic regions that contribute to variation in branching. Genomic regions that were associated with apical and mid-apical branching were generally distinct from those associated with basal and mid-basal branching. Homologs of known branching genes from other study systems (i.e., Arabidopsis, rice, pea, and petunia) were also identified from the draft assembly of the sunflower genome and their map positions were compared to those of associations identified herein. Numerous candidate branching genes were found to map in close proximity to significant branching associations. CONCLUSIONS: In sunflower, variation in branching is genetically complex and overall branching patterns (i.e., apical vs. basal) were found to be influenced by distinct genomic regions. Moreover, numerous candidate branching genes mapped in close proximity to significant branching associations. Although the sunflower genome exhibits localized islands of elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD), these non-random associations are known to decay rapidly elsewhere. The subset of candidate genes that co-localized with significant associations in regions of low LD represents the most promising target for future functional analyses.},

  abstract = {The golden proportion is widely believed to be extraordinarily prevalent in nature and the arts, which is often ascribed to it being the limit of the ratio between any two successive elements in the Fibonacci sequence. It is suggested here that the golden ratio may not be as exceptional as generally believed. Mathematically, some interesting properties are common to all members of a family of sequences, denoted ARS, characterised as solutions to the classic rabbit reproduction problem varying on some parameter, j, including the Fibonacci sequence as a prototypical member--ARS2. Furthermore, for j {$>$} 1, any limit of the ratio between successive elements in ARS(j), shares the same formal properties with all other such limits. Three actual interpretations and three further geometric applications of ARS3, all intimately analogous to corresponding ARS2 ones, are presented for the sake of illustration. Empirically, it is suggested here that, owing to the communality of interesting mathematical properties between ARS sequences, as well as between corresponding limits, nature might appear to have made use of some other limits, aside of its variegated use of the limit of ARS2--the golden ratio. Initial empirical clues are provided. Finally, the issue whether there really is special import to golden proportions in nature and the arts is revisited in view of some empirical comparisons of appearances related to Fibonacci numbers and ARS3 numbers, particular its limit (-1.466) and the inverse of that limit (-0.682). It is argued that the claim that Fibonacci-related numbers are especially distinguished seems to warrant a more qualified approach than it has often met.},

The front is generated primarily by a PIN1 mediated instability of a uniform auxin concentration and leaves in its wake an auxin fluctuation field at whose maxima new primordia are assumed to be initiated. Because it propagates through a slowly changing metric, the patterns have to make transitions between spirals enumerated by decreasing parastichy numbers. The point configurations of maxima coincide almost exactly with those configurations generated by the use of discrete algorithms based on optimal packing ideas which suggests that pushed pattern forming fronts may be a general mechanism by which natural organisms can follow optimal strategies.},

By deriving a continuum approximation of an existing discrete biochemical model and comparing it with a mechanical model, we show that the model partial differential equations are similar in form. The implications of this universality in the form of the equations on interpreting the results of simulations are discussed. We develop a combined model that incorporates the coupling of biochemistry and mechanics. The combined model is accessible to analysis by reduction to a set of ordinary differential equations for the amplitudes of shapes associated with both the auxin concentration field and plant surface deformation. Analysis of these amplitude equations reveals the parameter choices under which the two mechanisms may cooperate in determining the pattern, or under which one or the other mechanism may dominate.},

  abstract = {Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of a plant's phylla (flowers, bracts, stickers) near its shoot apical meristem (SAM), has intrigued natural scientists for centuries. Even today, the reasons for the observed patterns and their special properties, the physical and chemical mechanisms which give rise to strikingly similar configurations in a wide variety of plants, the almost-constant golden divergence angle, the almost constant plastichrone ratio, the choices of parastichy numbers and the prevalence of Fibonacci sequences to which their numbers belong, are at best only partially understood. Our goals in this Addendum are: i) To give a brief overview of current thinking on possible mechanisms for primordia (the bumps on the plant surface which eventually mature into fully developed structures such as leaves or florets) formation and give a descriptive narrative of the mathematical models which encode various hypotheses. ii) To emphasize the point that patterns, whether they be phyllotactic configurations on plant surfaces or convection cells on the sun's surface, are macroscopic objects whose behaviors are determined more by symmetries of the proposed model and less by microscopic details. Because of this, the identification of observations with the predications of a particular model can only be made with confidence when the match coincides over a range of circumstances and parameters. iii) To discuss some of the key results of the proposed models and, in particular, introduce the prediction of a new and, in principle, measurable invariant in plant phyllotaxis. iv) To introduce a new model of primordia formation which is more in keeping with the pictures and paradigms of Hofmeister,1 Snow \& Snow,2 and Douady and Couder3,4 which see primordia as forming in a fairly narrow annular zone surrounding the plant's SAM separating a region of undifferentiated cells from a fully developed patterned state. v) To consider the challenge of phyllotaxis in the broader context of pattern formation in biological tissue which responds to both mechanical and biochemical processes.

Changes in phyllotaxy significantly influence light interception (and, by inference, net assimilation rate) for rosette growth habits. However, changes in leaf shape and orientation and in stem length can compensate for the negative effects of leaf overlap produced by phyllotactic patterns. Phyllotaxy is viewed as a developmental limiting factor in photobiology that may necessitate compensatory changes in other morphological features not directly controlled by patterns of leaf initiation. This distinguishes it from functioning as a "developmental constraint" sensu stricto and may provide a paradigm for other features in plant evolution.},

  abstract = {Plant leaves are arranged around a stem axis in a regular pattern characterized by common fractions, a phenomenon known as phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy. As plants grow, these fractions often transition according to simple rules related to Fibonacci sequences. This mathematical regularity originates from leaf primordia at the shoot tip (shoot apical meristem), which successively arise at fixed intervals of a divergence angle, typically the golden angle of 137.5°. Algebraic and numerical interpretations have been proposed to explain the golden angle observed in phyllotaxis. However, it remains unknown whether phyllotaxis has adaptive value, even though two centuries have passed since the phenomenon was discovered. Here, I propose a new adaptive mechanism explaining the presence of the golden angle. This angle is the optimal solution to minimize the energy cost of phyllotaxis transition. This model accounts for not only the high precision of the golden angle but also the occurrences of other angles observed in nature. The model also effectively explains the observed diversity of rational and irrational numbers in phyllotaxis.},

The adaptive reason for this morphological convergence is unknown. In the non-spiral arrangement, the divergence angle between successive leaves is a simple fraction of 360°, e.g. distichy, decussate and whorled phyllotaxis. In the spiral arrangement, the divergence angle of nascent leaves at the shoot apex is fixed at the golden angle 137.5°, whereas those of the developed leaves varies within a sequence of Fibonacci fractions, such as 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, 5/13, etc. The optimality of the golden angle has been shown recently by assuming that the pattern of developed leaves varies during growth in a manner depending on the divergence angle of nascent leaves. Here we propose a unified rule of phyllotaxis to explain both types of arrangement: the developed leaves form vertical rows along the stem. In the non-spiral arrangement, nascent to developed leaves always follow this rule, so that the number of leaf rows is kept constant irrespective of stem growth. In the spiral arrangement, developed leaves attain this rule by adjusting the divergence angle from the golden angle. The spiral arrangement is adaptive in that the number of leaf rows varies during growth depending on shoot thickness.},

  abstract = {1. The structure of the inflorescence, the flower, and the fruit of the pineapple, Ananas comosus (L.) Merr., is described and interpreted. 2. The collective fruit is composed of numerous fruitlets and floral bracts which are connate with one another. Each hermaphroditic flower is trimerous in pattern and subtended by a prominent bract. 3. An important feature of the tricarpellate inferior ovary is the presence of septal glands which are, ontogenetically, the result of the incomplete fusion of adjacent carpel margins. The nectary duct, terminating each gland, provides a natural outlet from these glands into the blossom cup at the apex of the ovary. The glandular tissues show a definite transition from the secretory to the non-functional stage. The nectary duct and blossom-cup linings are transformed into an impervious, protective layer by combined processes of lignification, suberization, and formation of a periderm-like layer, thus protecting the fleshy tissues from the outside. 4. The stylar canals, which are open channels before anthesis, are closed by at least two methods: (a) mucilaginous plugging and (b) cellular occlusion by tylosis-like cells. 5. Two processes contribute to the increase in size of the fruit: cell multiplication in stages up to flowering and cell enlargement in the older bud to ripe-fruit stage. Cells of the internal tissues increase rapidly in size while the fruit is maturing, become fully distended upon ripening, and begin to show shrinkage when fully ripe. The overripe stages show softening and some disintegration of the walls and occasional cellular break-down; dissolution, however, does not take place until microbial decomposition sets in. 6. Morphologically, the pineapple fruit is formed by the complete fusion of the fruitlets of an inflorescence and their subtending floral bracts to one another and to the inflorescence axis. This fusion has taken place during phylogenetic development. The flowers have typical inferior ovaries with the normal vascular supply for such ovaries of the appendicular type. Fusion of traces to the various organs has occurred whenever these bundles lie in the same radii, as is to be expected in an inferior ovary which is the result of maximum adnation (8). Fusion, likewise, has occurred between the lateral bundles of the subtending bract and some of those of the sepals. The bracts are intimately fused to their subtended flowers and to adjacent bracts. The bulk of the noncarpellary tissue between the ovaries is composed of sepal and bract tissues.},

These images illustrate some of the key elements of our paper: the organization of florets into a planar canopy, hierarchical phyllotaxis, the dependency of floret type and petal size on their position in the inflorescence, and the deformation of some petals due to collisions. Photograph by Holger Casselmann licensed under CC BY SA 3.0. Abstract Showy inflorescences – clusters of flowers – are a common fea-ture of many plants, greatly contributing to their beauty. The large numbers of individual flowers (florets), arranged in space in a sys-tematic manner, make inflorescences a natural target for procedural modeling. We present a suite of biologically motivated algorithms for modeling and animating the development of inflorescences with closely packed florets. These inflorescences share the following characteristics: (i) in their ensemble, the florets form a relatively smooth, often approximately planar surface; (ii) there are numer-ous collisions between petals of the same or adjacent florets; and (iii) the developmental stage and type of a floret may depend on its position within the inflorescence, with drastic or gradual differ-ences. To model flat-topped branched inflorescences (corymbs and umbels), we propose a florets-first algorithm, in which the branch-ing structure self-organizes to support florets in predetermined po-sitions. This is an alternative to previous branching-first models, in which floret positions were determined by branch arrangement. To obtain realistic visualizations, we complement the algorithms that generate the inflorescence structure with an interactive method for modeling floret corollas (petal sets). The method supports corollas with both separate and fused petals. We illustrate our techniques with models from several plant families.},

  abstract = {The number of disc florets in the capitulum of the cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) varies according to genotype and to growing conditions experienced in the early life of the plant prior to floral stage 8. Disc florets are generated by the receptacle and are accommodated on its surface during the maturation of the capitulum. The influence of receptacle size upon floret number has been examined by firstly measuring the area of the receptacle and the region of floret initiation (generative area) during the period of floret production and secondly recording the number and persistence of the floret parastichies (rows). Phenotypes with contrasting floret numbers were produced by growing the F1 hybrid Hysun 30 under short or long photoperiods or under four levels of nitrate nitrogen. The influence of genotype was investigated by sampling populations of Hysun 30 and the cultivar Sunfola 68-2, together with an experimental hybrid Sirosun 25H and its male (25R) and female (89A) parental lines. It was established that phenotypic and genotypic variation in disc floret production is expressed through the regulation of receptacle expansion during floral stages 5 to 8. This controls the number of floret rows initiated in floral stage 5 and the number of florets produced by each row in floral stages 6, 7 and 8. It is shown that the total number of disc florets can be predicted either from the daily integral of the generative area or from the initial number of long floret rows and the number of florets in each using the empirical expression [a(0.67 f)] + [a′(0.33 f)] where a is the initial floret row number, f is the number of florets in a row, and a′ is the next number down from a in the Fibonacci series.},

What strikes the most in Matila Ghyka’s style is a technique of extensive self- quotation, which is not mere egocentrism. Whereas le Bon does not discriminate between Force and Matter and states that Matter is an infinite reservoir of intra-atomic energy, in the particular case of Matila’s writings, the degree in which textual matter (recollections, memories) dissociates or re-crystalizes indicates the actual force encapsulated in the point of departure (the object of recollection, experience as such). Textual series bring testimony to Ghyka’s strive to burn out variants to invariant (Happiness, the Golden Ratio), to drive meaning to a state of transparency.},

The portrait is interpreted as a programmatic statement, made in the ambience of the Caroline court after Van Dyck's appointment as 'Principal Painter', of his view of the art of painting. This statement, formulated in appropriately visual terms, characterizes painting as a way of looking and seeing, a mode of vision. In making such a claim, the artist steps aside from the familiar debate about whether painting was a manual or an intellectual discipline, and moves beyond any idea of it as simply a means of representing the external world: the painter's definitive faculty of vision can reach further than those realities which present themselves to the eye. John Peacock analyses the motif of looking - the ways in which figures regard or disregard each other - throughout Van Dyck's work, and the images of the sunflower and the gold chain in this particular portrait, to reveal what is essentially an idealist conception of pictorial art. He contradicts previous opinions that the artist was pedestrian in his thinking, by showing him to be familiar with a range of ideas current in contemporary Europe about painting and the role of the painter.},

  abstract = {In this article, the morphology of a brown alga is revisited and compared to the phyllotaxis of land plants. The alga, Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt has a highly organized thallus with a stipe, the stem-like main axis, and hierarchically organized lateral branches of successive orders. Around each of these axes, the lateral organs: blades, side-branches, and receptacles grow in a spiral disposition. As in land plants, this organization is related to an apical mode of growth. Measurements performed along the mature differentiated axes as well as in their meristematic regions confirm the similarity of the large-scale organization of this brown alga with that of the land plants. In particular, the divergence angle between successive elements has similar values and it results from the existence around the meristem of parastichies having the same Fibonacci ordering. This is remarkable in view of the fact that brown algae (Phaeophyceae) and land plants (Embryophyta) are two clades that diverged approximately 1800 million years ago when they were both unicellular organisms. We argue that the observed similarity results from a morphogenetic convergence. This is in strong support of the genericity and robustness of self-organization models in which similar structures, here Fibonacci related spirals, can be obtained in various situations in which the genetic and physiological implementation of development can be of a different nature.},

The author believes that the morphogenetic significance of iterative algorithms in biology is attributable to the mechanisms of interaction in biological layers of tissues and replication of supramolecular structures. The geometrical fundamentals of classical biomorphology need expansion and a generalized biomorphology has to be developed by replacing the conventional similarity symmetries by broader ranges of higher-order transformations (notably Mo¨bius and projective). The progress of theoretical biology is today contingent on more extensive use of group-theoretic methods incorporating higher-order symmetries.},

  abstract = {Gustav Fechner is widely respected as a founding father of experimental psychology and psychophysics but fewer know of his interests and work in empirical aesthetics. In the later 1800s, toward the end of his career, Fechner performed experiments to empirically evaluate the beauty of rectangles, hypothesizing that the preferred shape would closely match that of the so-called 'golden rectangle'. His findings confirmed his suspicions, but in the intervening decades there has been significant evidence pointing away from that finding. Regardless of the results of this one study, Fechner ushered in the notion of using a metric to evaluate beauty in a psychophysical way. In this paper, we recreate the experiment using more naturalistic stimuli. We evaluate subjects' preferences against models that use various types of object complexity as metrics. Our findings that subjects prefer either very simple or very complex objects runs contrary to the hypothesized results, but are systematic none the less. We conclude that there are likely to be useful measures of aesthetic preference but they are likely to be complicated by the difficulty in defining some of their constituent parts.},

  abstract = {. In recent years, models for lattices of discrete cells have been attracting increased attention due to their greater flexibility to represent signalling and contact-dependent cell-cell interaction than conventional reaction-diffusion models.Using the almost forgotten method of Othmer and Scriven (1971) to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the Jacobian of the homogeneous state, a Turing-like linear stability analysis is carried out for diffusion-driven (DD) and signalling-driven (SD) discrete models. The method is a generalisation of the original method of Turing (1952). For two-species models it is found that there are profound differences between the two types of model when the size of the lattice increases. For DD models, the homogeneous state is typically either always stable, always unstable, or becomes unstable when the lattice gets suffficiently large. For SD models, the homogeneous state is typically unstable independent of lattice size, and stable only in a minor part of parameter space. Thus, SD models seem in general more pattern-prone than DD models.The conjecture that the linear analysis predicts the final pattern is investigated for a DD system with Thomas internal dynamics. Commonly the final pattern resembles the pattern of the initial perturbation of the homogeneous state, but this is by no means a general feature. When applied to a recent model for Delta-Notch lateral inhibition, linear analysis must be supplemented by various non-linear techniques to get a deeper insight into the patterning mechanisms. The overall conclusion is that a linear Turing analysis may be useful for predicting pattern, but when it comes to explaining patterns, non-linear analysis cannot be ignored.},

  abstract = {The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants explores mathematical models of developmental processes and structures of plants, and illustrates them using state-of-the-art computer-generated images. Plant models which grow, interact with the environment, produce flowers and fruits, and finally die, have an immense intuitive appeal of "bringing life into a computer." In front of a graphics monitor it is easy to forget the underlying mathematical formulae and simply look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors, even mutating. Without compromising the mathematical rigor of presentation the authors have tried to preserve this "touch of magic" accompanying in their research. The following areas receive particular attention: methods for the modeling and rendering of plants which are suitable for realistic image synthesis; the scientific potential of computer graphics in the visualization of biological structures and processes; the relationship between control mechanisms employed by li- ing plants and the resulting complex developmental sequences and structures; and the relationship between developmental processes, self-similarity and fractals. The formalism of L-systems are adopted as the primary mathematical vehicle used to express developmental processes. The notion of L-systems was conceived in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer as a formal model of plant development. Its exceptional elegance was promptly recognized by mathematicians, who soon developed a comprehensive theory of L-systems. However, only recently has computer graphics revealed the full potential of L-systems applied to plant modeling. Although the focus is on the original results of joint research led by the authors, a survey of alternative methods for plant modeling is also included.},

The migration of the sunflower eastward in Europe occurred during the 17th century. Archaeological evidence reveals the use of sunflower among American Indians. Within recorded history, after the discoveries in the Americas by European explorers, frequent reference is made to the use of the sunflower plant by the native people. Most sunflower historians agree that the present cultivated sunflower in North America stems from materials reintroduced from Russia after the crop became widely grown there.

Whether disorders induced by biological noise may carry information on building principles of developmental systems is an important debated question. Here, we addressed theoretically this question using phyllotaxis, the geometric arrangement of plant aerial organs, as a model system. Phyllotaxis arises from reiterative organogenesis driven by lateral inhibitions at the shoot apex. Motivated by recurrent observations of disorders in phyllotaxis patterns, we revisited in depth the classical deterministic view of phyllotaxis. We developed a stochastic model of primordia initiation at the shoot apex, integrating locality and stochasticity in the patterning system. This stochastic model recapitulates phyllotactic patterns, both regular and irregular, and makes quantitative predictions on the nature of disorders arising from noise. We further show that disorders in phyllotaxis instruct us on the parameters governing phyllotaxis dynamics, thus that disorders can reveal biological watermarks of developmental systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Spiral patterns characterized by Fibonacci numbers have attracted the particular interest of natural scientists and mathematicians. Numerous reviews have dealt with the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying phyllotaxis, and modeling studies have sought to recreate phyllotaxis according to mathematical, biochemical, or physical laws. However, what is the functional significance of regular plant architecture, and how did it evolve? We discuss the developmental constraints and selective forces that may have favored the selection of phyllotaxis, and we argue that a central driver of regular phyllotaxis may have been limitations in the allocation of founder cells and metabolic resources to the different tissues in the shoot apex.},

Numerous theoretical models, that are based on biochemical, biophysical and other principles, have been proposed to explain the development of the patterns. Recently, auxin has been identified as the inducer of organ formation. An emerging model for phyllotaxis states that polar auxin transport in the plant apex generates local peaks in auxin concentration that determine the site of organ formation and thereby the different phyllotactic patterns found in nature. The PIN proteins play a primary role in auxin transport. These proteins are localized in a polar fashion, reflecting the directionality of polar auxin transport. Recent evidence shows that most aspects of phyllotaxis can be explained by the expression pattern and the dynamic subcellular localization of PIN1.},

  abstract = {The regular arrangement of leaves around a plant's stem, called phyllotaxis, has for centuries attracted the attention of philosophers, mathematicians and natural scientists; however, to date, studies of phyllotaxis have been largely theoretical. Leaves and flowers are formed from the shoot apical meristem, triggered by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported through plant tissues by specific cellular influx and efflux carrier proteins. Here we show that proteins involved in auxin transport regulate phyllotaxis. Our data indicate that auxin is transported upwards into the meristem through the epidermis and the outermost meristem cell layer. Existing leaf primordia act as sinks, redistributing auxin and creating its heterogeneous distribution in the meristem. Auxin accumulation occurs only at certain minimal distances from existing primordia, defining the position of future primordia. This model for phyllotaxis accounts for its reiterative nature, as well as its regularity and stability.},

  abstract = {Current methods of classifying the phyllotaxis patterns found at stem apices are discussed, and it is concluded that the numerical measures employed do not characterize solely the arrangement or positioning of the primordia, but are partially determined also by primordial shape. A method of phyllotaxis assessment is proposed that is free from this ambiguity. For a complete description three parameters are necessary, namely, the angle of the cone tangential to the apex in the region under consideration, the divergence angle, and the plastochrone ratio, i.e. the ratio of the radial distances of two successive primordia from the central axis. For assessment of the transverse component of the system the two last parameters are alone required. Of these three characteristics the plastochrone ratio is the most useful, and from it a 'phyllotaxis index' may be calculated that immediately conveys the most essential information relating to the primordial arrangement. Since this index is a continuously varying function, phyllotaxis assessment is no longer confined to a few discrete recognized systems, and it becomes possible to compare quantitatively with one another phyllotaxis arrangements of very diverse kinds. The relationship between the index and primordial pattern is presented for all important divergence angles, and also for those systems wherein more than one leaf appears at each node. The phyllotaxis index is rigidly related to the ratio of the transverse components of two areas, that of the central apex and that of the newly initiated primordium; a simple extension enables a similar relationship to be determined on the actual apical surface, opening the way for a practical adaptation of the older theoretical concept of 'bulk ratio'.},

These parameters are the divergence , which is assumed to be constant, and a quantity , which is the reciprocal of the normalized rise, and which in general varies from point to point.

It is proposed that the initiation and subsequent development of leaf (or other organ) primordia at the shoot apex proceeds as follows. Firstly, primordia are initiated at points on the apex where the nutrient level exceeds a certain threshold. The apical tip and existing primordia compete for nutrients, which move vertically more readily than tangentially. After they have been initiated, the primordia grow by spreading preferentially into areas of high nutrient density, so that the relative positions of their mid-points, and hence the divergence angles between successive primordia, are altered as a result of chemical contact pressure. This mechanism, coupled with the assumption of a decreasing ratio of the vertical spacing (corrected to account for the greater vertical mobility of nutrients) to the apical girth, leads to Fibonacci phyllotaxis, provided the primordia are initiated singly. Fujita's observations of divergence angle frequency are shown to be in good agreement with the proposed theory.},

  abstract = {Adler's contact pressure model for Fibonacci phyllotaxis is examined theoretically. It is shown that the model, as it stands, does not account for Fibonacci phyllotaxis, since it requires, but does not provide, a mechanism for initiating new primordia with increasingly greater precision as phyllotaxis rises. Modifications are suggested which remedy this deficiency in the model; one of these modifications involves a combination of Adler's model with Mitchison's model. From a comparison of the ranges of divergence angles permitted by Adler's model against Fujita's measurements of divergence angles in plants with low phyllotaxis, it is shown that the modified contact pressure model, if based on the concept of mechanical pressures between primordia in contact, cannot account for the divergence angles found in low phyllotaxis systems. However it is shown that this deficiency can be overcome if the contact pressure effect is regarded as a chemical phenomenon, mediated by a growth inhibitor produced by the prirnordia and moving more readily in vertical directions than in other directions. Mitchison's model, which is based on the concepts of an expanding apex and primordium initiation by existing primordia, is shown to account for Fibonacci phyllotaxis only if phyllotaxis rises sufficiently slowly; to guarantee that an Fn + Fn+1 system can develop there must already be at least Fn+1 primordia present in an Fn−1 + Fn system, at least Fn primordia in an Fn−2 + Fn−1 system, and so on down to at least three primordia in a 1 + 2 system, making a total of at least Fn+3−5 primordia (where Fn = nth term of the Fibonacci series with F1 = F2 = 1). Adler's model, modified, requires only that Fn + 1 primordia be present with divergence angles in the range 120–180° to guarantee that an Fn + Fn + 1 system can develop.},

  abstract = {The development of an organism results from complex interactions between biophysical and biochemical processes and is very dynamic. Therefore the mechanisms at play are best studied using computer simulations. The large amount of molecular data on multiple aspects of plant development and advances in plant imaging make it possible to use simulation modelling as a tool to complement experimental studies. For instance, models of gene regulation networks can predict genetic interactions, which can later be tested experimentally. Models of pattern formation in the root and the shoot based on the transport of the plant hormone auxin can simulate the localization of proteins involved in auxin efflux as well as generating realistic profiles of auxin distribution. Models are also starting to incorporate growth and the role of mechanical forces in development, which should provide a link between molecular biology studies and biophysics. Key conceptsKey concepts * Plant development is highly dynamic as pattern formation and growth occur concurrently. * Modelling studies which can account for observed experimental data suggest genetic interactions in space can generate spatial patterns during plant development in a similar way to reaction-diffusion mechanisms initially postulated in the middle of the twentieth century. * Models of the relation between auxin gradient and root growth suggests the plant hormone auxin acts similarly to a morphogen. In the case of auxin the response to the morphogen may affect the morphogen gradient. This feedback mechanism can generate patterns similar to reaction diffusion and may account for phyllotaxis and leaf vein pattern formation. Experimental data is still needed to link models of auxin-regulated pattern formation with gene regulatory networks. * Mechanical forces affect growth and pattern formation. Methodologies are being developed to model the biomechanics of growth and integrate patterning through chemical and physical processes at various scales of organization.}

  abstract = {Driesch's statement, made around 1900, that the physics and chemistry of his day were unable to explain self-regulation during embryogenesis was correct and could be extended until the year 1972. The emergence of theories of self-organisation required progress in several areas including chemistry, physics, computing and cybernetics. Two parallel lines of development can be distinguished which both culminated in the early 1970s. Firstly, physicochemical theories of self-organisation arose from theoretical (Lotka 1910-1920) and experimental work (Bray 1920; Belousov 1951) on chemical oscillations. However, this research area gained broader acceptance only after thermodynamics was extended to systems far from equilibrium (1922-1967) and the mechanism of the prime example for a chemical oscillator, the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction, was deciphered in the early 1970s. Secondly, biological theories of self-organisation were rooted in the intellectual environment of artificial intelligence and cybernetics. Turing wrote his The chemical basis of morphogenesis (1952) after working on the construction of one of the first electronic computers. Likewise, Gierer and Meinhardt's theory of local activation and lateral inhibition (1972) was influenced by ideas from cybernetics. The Gierer-Meinhardt theory provided an explanation for the first time of both spontaneous formation of spatial order and of self-regulation that proved to be extremely successful in elucidating a wide range of patterning processes. With the advent of developmental genetics in the 1980s, detailed molecular and functional data became available for complex developmental processes, allowing a new generation of data-driven theoretical approaches. Three examples of such approaches will be discussed. The successes and limitations of mathematical pattern formation theory throughout its history suggest a picture of the organism, which has structural similarity to views of the organic world held by the philosopher Immanuel Kant at the end of the eighteenth century. © The Author(s) 2011.

  abstract = {Phyllotaxis, i.e., the arrangement of leaves around the stem and leaf-like organs inside flowers is regular in most vascular plants. Thus, developmental models usually explain regular phyllotactic patterns such as Fibonacci spirals and decussate/whorled patterns that obey Hofmeister’s rule: primordia form as far away as possible from previously initiated primordia. However, flowering plants showing at first Fibonacci spirals or whorled phyllotaxes may switch to other patterns that lack an obvious order and thus may be called irregular or even chaotic. Vegetative shoot tips of various Australian wattles (Acacia spp., Leguminosae in eudicots) and flower buds of ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata) and other Annonaceae (basal angiosperms) provide examples of irregular patterning. This pictorial report provides food for thought for scientists interested in phyllotaxis patterns beyond the usual spiral and whorled patterns. Emphasis is given on irregular phyllotaxes that occur in wild-type plants, mainly correlated with geometrical parameters such as leaf and stamen primordia that are very small as compared to the size of their apical meristems. They call for additional explanatory models, combining auxin-driven development with geometrical constraints and biophysical processes.},

Various methods for fixing the capitulum centre were examined. It was concluded that sunflower capitula do not possess an uniquely defined growth centre; the physical reasons for this are discussed. The analysis revealed persistent oscillations in both divergence angles and radial functions, for both species. Theoretical bases for this result are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {Plants continuously generate new tissues and organs throughout their life cycle, due to the activity of populations of specialized tissues containing stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) generates all the aboveground organs of the plant, including leaves and flowers, and plays a key role in plant survival and reproduction. Organ production at the SAM occurs following precise spatio-temporal patterns known as phyllotaxis. Because of the regularity of these patterns, phyllotaxis has been the subject of investigations from biologists, physicists, and mathematicians for several centuries. Both experimental and theoretical works have led to the idea that phyllotaxis results from a self-organizing process in the meristem via long-distance interactions between organs. In recent years, the phytohormone auxin has emerged not only as the central regulator of organogenesis at the SAM, but also as a major determinant of the self-organizing properties of phyllotaxis. Here, we discuss both the experimental and theoretical evidence for the implication of auxin in the control of organogenesis and self-organization of the SAM. We highlight how several layers of control acting at different scales contribute together to the function of the auxin signal in SAM dynamics. We also indicate a role for mechanical forces in the development of the SAM, supported by recent interdisciplinary studies.},

The "rapporteur" shares the view of the "observer" that the confusion of childish-youthful sexual development not only through theoretical enlightenment, but also through "one practical, immediately more vivid knowledge ". The coitus is widely overestimated in the opinion of the "attendant", since "the psychosexual tension mostly through various sexual caresses and the achievement of orgasm through masturbation to complete satisfaction can be".

For this purpose, it identifies the interfield theories that allowed biologists and chemists to use each other's techniques and findings, and that provided the basis for the experiments performed to identify plant growth hormones and to learn more about their role in the mechanism of plant growth. In 1930, chemists and biologists in Utrecht and Pasadena began to cooperatively study plant growth. I will argue that these researchers decided to join forces because they believed to rely on each other's findings and methods to solve their research problems adequately. In the course of the cooperation, organic chemists arrived at isolating plant growth hormones by using a test method developed in plant physiology. This achievement, in turn, facilitated biologists' investigation of the mechanism of plant growth. Researchers eventually believed to have the means to study the relation between a substance's molecular structure and its physiological activity. The way they conceptualized the problem of identifying hormones and unraveling the mechanism of plant growth, as well as their actual research actions are compatible with the new mechanists' account of mechanism research. The study illustrates that focusing on researchers' mechanistic reasoning can contribute considerably to explaining the structure of cross-disciplinary research projects.},

  abstract = {A model of phyllotaxy is presented based on the concept of a diffusible inhibitor emanating from each new growth centre (primordium). The inhibitor is regarded as subject to polar transport in the symplast in a basipetal direction so that its movement is largely restricted to the transverse and downward directions, with only a small amount of upward (perhaps apoplastic) translocation. A computer model for this has been devised employing constants for the following parameters: r, the radius of the “anneau initial”; s, the inhibitor source strength of each primordium; t, the threshold concentration of the inhibitor (below which a new growth centre may form); g, the polar transport constant; and , the semi-vertical angle of the cone. By considering the ratio of s/t as a single parameter the required number of parameters reduces to only four. It is demonstrated how, using these parameters, the common types of phyllotaxis ranging from whorled to spiral, distichous, decussate and their transitions may be derived, and what quantitative changes in these parameters will bring about transitions from one system to another such as are known to occur in nature. These can be shown on cylindrical surfaces ( = 0) and conical surfaces as in plant apices. This simple and flexible model also demonstrates that unstable situations with regard to the divergence angle can only arise over narrow changes in value of these parameters while phyllotactic systems found in nature are stable over considerable ranges of magnitude in the parameters.},

In plants, the control circuits that underlie division and differentiation within meristems have been well studied, but those that underlie feedback on meristems from lateral organs remain largely unknown. Here we show that long-distance auxin transport mediates this feedback in a non-cell-autonomous manner. A low-auxin zone is associated with the shoot apical meristem (SAM) organization center, and auxin levels negatively affect SAM size. Using computational model simulations, we show that auxin transport from lateral organs can inhibit auxin transport from the SAM through an auxin transport switch and thus maintain SAM auxin homeostasis and SAM size. Genetic and microsurgical analyses confirmed the model's predictions. In addition, the model explains temporary change in SAM size of \emph{yabby} mutants. Our study suggests that the canalization-based auxin flux can be widely adapted as a feedback control mechanism in plants.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A close correlation was found between bracts and rays, and attributed to the fact that the rays are axillary to the bracts. The degree of imbrication of the bracts was observed to bear a relation to the number of empty bracts. Curves and "constants" were determined for the material of the four species studied. "Constants" determined for several individuals of A puniceus L. growing in identical surroundings indicated how great variations may exist in the variability "constants" of individuals. Studies upon successive collections from a single group of specimens of A. prenanthoides Muhl. showed that the number of bracts, rays, and disk florets all decrease continuously from the beginning to the end of the flowering season, and that the character of the curves and the position of their means and modes likewise change continuously. I wish to express my thanks to Prof. W. L. Tower for his kindly interest and helpful suggestion during the prosecution of these studies, and also for the revision of the manuscript.},

Transgenic DKK overexpression reduces overall appendage density. Moderate suppression of endogenous WNT signaling forces follicles to form clusters during an otherwise normal morphogenetic program. These results confirm predictions of a WNT/DKK-specific mathematical model and provide in vivo corroboration of the reaction-diffusion mechanism for epidermal appendage formation.},

Recent molecular-genetic experiments indicate that active transport of the plant hormone auxin is the key process regulating phyllotaxis. A conceptual model based on these experiments, introduced by Reinhardt et al. [Reinhardt, D., Pesce, E. R., Stieger, P., Mandel, T., Baltensperger, K., et al. (2003) Nature 426, 255–260], provides an intuitively plausible interpretation of the data, but raises questions of whether the proposed mechanism is, in fact, capable of producing the observed temporal and spatial patterns, is robust, can start de novo, and can account for phyllotactic transitions, such as the frequently observed transition from decussate to spiral phyllotaxis. To answer these questions, we created a computer simulation model based on data described previously or in this paper and reasonable hypotheses. The model reproduces, within the standard error, the divergence angles measured in Arabidopsis seedlings and the effects of selected experimental manipulations. It also reproduces distichous, decussate, and tricussate patterns. The model thus offers a plausible link between molecular mechanisms of morphogenesis and the geometry of phyllotaxis.},

The normal mean angle between successive pairs of leaves was found to be 72° · 7. Experiments are reported which were designed to test a suggestion that in bijugates the deviation of each new pair from a position at right angles to that of the previous pair is due to an inhibition from the second older pair below. The leaves of the apical buds were removed as far as the youngest pair (the P1's) inclusive, or as far as the P2's or P3's only. After the operations the angles between successive pairs increased considerably, and the increases continued for five or even six plastochrons. Also some angles increased beyond 90° and reversed the spirals. It is pointed out that these results are difficult to reconcile with the inhibition hypothesis. Comparison is made with the bijugy of apices of Salvia horminoides, which can be explained junctionally as due to the contacts 1, 1 and 2 of the leaf bases. For the bijugy of Dipsacus an explanation is suggested in terms of the combined working of two factors. The first factor is junctional and depends on the shapes of the leaf bases with their united rims. The second factor is a pressure exerted by the upstanding parts of the P2's on the sides of the stem apex, which they were seen to touch. The results of the experiments can also be understood on this basis.},

  abstract = {Previously we found (1952, 1955) that in Lupinus albus when thesumm it of the stem apex was weakened with a prick, the leaves arose subsequently from smaller areas; and we con­cluded that normally the summ it of the apex exerts some inhibiting influence on the leaf­-forming zone, which needs to be overcome before a new leaf can be determined. Here it is shown that if several of the leaves of the bud are cut down repeatedly rather low, the youngest leaf and the new leaves are found subsequently to cover larger arcs of the circumference, so that normally the leaves of the bud must somehow decrease the arcs of the youngest and of the new leaves. In order, therefore, to compare more closely the effects of the leaves with those of the summit of the apex, we repeated the experiment by which we previously estimated the primary arc over which a leaf is determined, splitting with a vertical cut the presumptive area of I1 or I2, the next two leaves due to arise, and later measuring the angular distance from the wound of the morphological centre of a new leaf determined at one side of the wound and abutting on it. But this time we combined the operation with cutting down the leaves of the bud either very lightly or more severely. No difference was found to be made to the primary arc of the new leaf by the severity with which the leaves of the bud were cut down, although the variation was very small. So it follows that normally the leaves of the bud decrease the secondary lateral extension of the bases of the new leaves, whereas the summit of the apex increases the area of the apical surface which is needed for their determination. The primary leaf arc estimated from the present experiments is 90°, which is much less than the previous estimate of 124° or 122° (1933, 1952). This is apparently because a quite different race of Lupinus was used, and other evidence confirms that in this race the primary leaf arc is much smaller.},

  abstract = {The chief peculiarity of spirodistichous phyllotaxis, shown, for example, by Rhoeo discolor, is that it is spiral instead of distichous, although each leaf makes contact at its base with the next older leaf only. Previously (1951) the writer suggested as an explanation that in this species the position of each new leaf depends on a balance of physiological repulsions from the centres of the two or more next older leaves; for it did not seem possible to explain the spirodistichy on the basis of a spaceoccupying theory such as had been found to hold good for various dicotyledons. This suggestion was based on experiments in which the central part of P1, the youngest visible leaf, was removed, and the angular positions of the subsequent leaves, I1 and I2, were found to differ from the normal in such a way that these leaves appeared to be displaced towards the removed leaf centre. But later it was found that when the central part of P2 was removed, I1 was not appreciably displaced towards P2, as it was expected to be, unless the part removed was very large. This made the previous explanation very doubtful, and another explanation was sought. It was found by measurements of the angles between older leaves that the growing-point of the apex shifted away from the wound after the operations on P1, but only after the more severe of the operations on P2. It is shown that on the basis of a space-filling theory of leaf determination the shift of the growing-point, acting in various ways, is enough to account for the displacements of I1 and I2 towards the wound after the previous operations on P1 and the displacement of I1 after the more severe operations on P2. The question arises therefore whether the normal spirodistichy can be explained without postulating physiological repulsions. It is shown that in Rhoeo the flanks of a leaf, extending round the apex, are able to approach the summit of the apex in passing over an obstacle, and it is suggested that the phyllotaxis is spiral because each new leaf, n, is caused to deviate laterally by the flank of leaf n-1 beneath it, which rises towards the summit of the apex in passing over the centre and axillary bud of leaf n-2, a suggestion first made to the writer by Professor G. van Iterson. Also the results of other operations on the apex of Rhoeo are reported and are interpreted similarly on the basis of a space-filling theory, as due to the shift of the growing-point acting in various ways, and the peculiar powers of development of the leaf flanks. The development of the axillary buds and seedlings is described and interpreted on a similar basis. So it is not necessary to postulate physiological repulsions in order to explain leaf determination in Rhoeo, nor to suppose that the process is fundamentally different from what it is in dicotyledons. The base of each leaf in Rhoeo is normally asymmetric, its anodic half being shorter peripherally, but thicker radially. After various operations on the apex the shapes of the bases of the next three leaves that arise are often changed, and a study of these changes has made it possible to suggest an explanation of the asymmetries of the leaves both after the operations and in normal apices. Some changes in the eccentricities of axillary buds are also reported.},

  abstract = {A theory is proposed to account for the exact regulation of phyllotaxis systems. It is consistent with a space-filling or packing interpretation of phyllotaxis, and is based on evidence showing that, at least in Lupinus albus, each leaf base is determined over a primary area which covers a constant arc of the circumference of the apex, and then extends further secondarily before its turn comes to act as a contact member for younger leaf bases above. The theory is that the secondary extension of a leaf base varies as the divergence angle between its two contact leaves below, and that this gradually regulates a disturbed system. Evidence of this correlation is offered, and its cause and imperfections are discussed. To test the theory, a first diagram is constructed showing a regular phyllotaxis system with contacts 2 and 3 and with divergence 137°, as in L. albus, and with the leaf bases represented by circles as if on the surface of an unrolled cylinder. An inner circle represents the primary area of each leaf base and an outer circle its area when later it acts as a contact member for younger leaves. Two further diagrams are then constructed which at the base are similar to the last, but higher up show a leaf that has been displaced 20° laterally in either direction by splitting vertically its presumptive area, as was done in the experiments on L. albus. From this level onwards the diagrams are continued in accordance with space-filling principles, by inserting the constant primary area of each leaf base in its turn into the lowest available space between the older ones and then surrounding it with a concentric zone of secondary extension proportional in width to the divergence of its contact leaves below. The diagrams return towards the previous regular arrangement about as quickly as the comparable actual apices, and finally become more regular than a normal apex. It is therefore claimed that the theory provides an escape from the chief difficulty confronting a space-filling interpretation of phyllotaxis. The changes of phyllotaxis in the more severely disturbed apices are described and interpreted, including several changes to spirals with four leaves in a turn. The shapes and development of the leaf bases are discussed in relation to regulation in this and other species.},

The book is focused on angiosperm species with some examples from different groups of plants. "Essentials of Developmental Plant Anatomy" starts with an introductory chapter and a brief introduction to plant cell structure, which is followed by the structure of the flower, plant reproduction (vegetative and sexual) and the development and structure of embryo - the precursor to the plant body. Each chapter then deals with essential information on the shoot system, diversity of plant cells and tissues, the structure and development of the stem, leaf, root, and the secondary body.},

This volume is an extensively revised and completely updated version of a book that was first published in 1972. Much new material has been introduced; rapid advances in molecular biology in recent years have made a significant contribution to the understanding of development, and these exciting findings have been drawn into the interpretations provided in this new edition. At the same time, it is recognized that plant morphologists have made major strides in understanding the organization of the whole plant, and thus the developmental significance of architectural analysis is also stressed. The book is written so that anyone who has completed a basic first-year university course in biology or botany will be able to use it without difficulty. Sufficient background information is provided so that the reader is not required to have an extensive technical background.},

For isotropic growth d=1.7, at both high and low noise. For anisotropic growth with reduced noise the dimension can be as low as d=1.5 and apparently is not universal. Also, we study the fluctuations of particle areas and observe, in agreement with previous studies, that exceptionally large particles may appear during growth, leading to pathologically irregular clusters. This difficulty is circumvented by using an acceptance window for particle areas.},

In developing organs, positional information can be idealized as a local coordinate system that arises from morphogen gradients controlled by organizers at key locations. This offers a plausible mechanism for the integration of the molecular networks operating in individual cells into the spatially-coordinated multicellular responses necessary for the organization of emergent forms. Understanding how positional cues guide morphogenesis requires the quantification of gene expression and growth dynamics in the context of their underlying coordinate systems. Here we present recent advances in the MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et al. eLife 2015;4:e05864) that implement a generalized framework to annotate developing organs with local coordinate systems. These coordinate systems introduce an organ-centric spatial context to microscopy data, allowing gene expression and growth to be quantified and compared in the context of the positional information thought to control them.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a model of plant organ placement motivated by the appearance of large Fibonacci numbers in phyllotaxis, and provides the first large-scale empirical validation of this model. Specifically it evaluates the ability of Schwendener disk-stacking models to generate parastichy patterns seen in a large dataset of sunflower seedheads. We find that features of this data that the models can account for include a predominance of Fibonacci counts, usually in a pair of left and right counts on a single seedhead, a smaller but detectable frequency of Lucas and double Fibonacci numbers, a comparable frequency of Fibonacci numbers plus or minus one, and occurrences of pairs of roughly equal but non-Fibonacci counts in a `columnar' structure. A further observation in the dataset was an occasional lack of rotational symmetry in the parastichy spirals, and this paper demonstrates those in the model for the first time. Schwendener disk-stacking models allow Fibonacci structure by ensuring that a parameter of the model corresponding to the speed of plant growth is kept small enough. While many other models can exhibit Fibonacci structure, usually by specifying a rotation parameter to an extremely high precision, no other model has accounted for further, non-Fibonacci, features in the observed data. The Schwendener model produces these naturally in the region of parameter space just beyond where the Fibonacci structure breaks down, without any further parameter fitting. We also introduce stochasticity into the model and show that it while it can be responsible for the appearance of columnar structure, the disordered dynamics of the deterministic system near the critical region can also generate this structure.},

When his editors came to publish the morphogenesis volume of the Collected Works in 1992 they struggled with the fragmentary nature of \textbackslash emph\{The Morphogen Theory of Phyllotaxis\} and \textbackslash emph\{Outline of the Development of the Daisy\} and these images, without captions or a clear place, were not included. But in fact they tell a fascinating story of Turing's quest to explain, among much else, the appearance of Fibonacci numbers in the natural world. They have considerable historical interest as very early graphics of computational biology, but the work they represent remained in advance of published theory for decades. It is one goal of this article to represent these Figures and to explain their origin in the context of Turing's phyllotactic theory. The other goal is to provide a partial guide to those aspects of the surviving fragmentary works which can be understood from this perspective.},

This fact explains why the main Fibonacci pattern plays the dominant role among other patterns of spiral phyllotaxis. The probability that the pattern becomes unstable varies for different patterns, which likely makes them more or less frequent, and thus easier or more difficult to encounter in nature. The unstable pattern inevitably transforms into another, as the computer simulations show. Theoretically predicted instability of low order phyllotaxis may be treated as one of the causes of natural ontogenetic transitions, occurring in plants. This, however, still does not explain why in nature some patterns with high order of phyllotaxis also change, quite readily one into the other, in shoot apical meristem’s ontogeny.},

  abstract = {Turning Images in Philosophy, Science, and Religion: A New Book of Nature brings together new essays addressing the role of images and imagination recruited in the perennial debates surrounding nature, mind, and God. The debate between "new atheists" and religious apologists today is often hostile. This book sets a new tone by locating the debate between theism and naturalism (most "new atheists" are self-described "naturalists") in the broader context of reflection on imagination and aesthetics. The eleven essays will be of interest to anyone who is fascinated by the power of imagination and the role of aesthetics in deciding between worldviews or philosophies of nature. Representing a variety of points of view, authors include outstanding philosophers of religion and of science, a distinguished art historian, and a visual artist. The book begins with Martin Kemp's essay on the work of the biologist, mathematician and classical scholar D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson in which Kemp develops the idea of "structural intuitions and a critique of reductive thinking about the natural world. This is followed by Geoffrey Gorham's overview and analysis of images of nature and God found in early modern science and philosophy. Anthony O'Hear questions a reductive, naturalist account of the origin of mind and values. Dale Jacquette offers a thoroughgoing naturalistic philosophy of the emergence of intentionality and a unique argument about the emergence of art and the aesthetic appreciation of nature. E.J. Lowe brings to light some challenges facing naturalistic approaches to human imaginative sensibility. Douglas Hedley articulates and defends a cognitive account of imagination, highlighting some of the difficulties confronting naturalism. Daniel N. Robinson offers a sweeping treatment of nature and naturalism, historically engaging Aristotle, Kant, Hegel and others. Conor Cunningham provides an aggressive critique of contemporary naturalism. Gordon Graham investigates the resources of naturalism in accounting for our sense of the sacred. Mark Wynn provides a subtle understanding of imagination and perception, suggesting how these may play into the theism - naturalism debate. The book concludes with Jil Evans' reflections on how images of the Galapagos Islands have been employed philosophically to picture either a naturalist or theistic image of nature.},

He then gained a science scholarship at Jesus College, Oxford, coming into residence in 1891, and the whole of the rest of his life was spent in the University city. In 1894 Church graduated in the first class of the Honour School of Botany, and in the same year was appointed demonstrator in the Department of Botany by Vines, who was then Sherardian Professor. In 1894 he took the London degree of D.Sc., from 1908 to 1912 was a Research Fellow of Jesus College, in 1921 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and from 1908 till his retirement under the age limit in 1930 he held the title of Lecturer in Botany. Thus for 36 years Church worked as teacher and investigator in one University Department. He died at his house in Oxford on 24 April 1937, aged 72.},

When used for anatomically preserved fossils, Lepidodendron is usually now restricted to the group of species allied to Lepidodendron hickii, but this results in confusion and potential disruption to the traditional use of the fossil-genus for non-anatomically preserved stems. The case is made for separate sets of fossil-genera for the anatomically and non-anatomically preserved stems, with the circumscription of Lepidodendron being limited to adpressions, casts and moulds. A new fossil-genus, Dimicheleodendron gen. nov., is proposed for the lycophyte stem petrifactions typified by Lepidodendron hickii.},

The role of the scientist is emphasized, as proposer, receiver and evaluator of ideas about the shoot apical meristem. Models have become increasingly popular over the last 250~years, and we consider their role. They provide valuable grounding for the development of hypotheses, but in addition they have a strong human element and their uptake relies on various degrees of persuasion. The most influential models are probably those that most data support, consolidating them as an insight into reality; but they also work by altering how we see meristems, re-directing us to influence the data we collect and the questions we consider meaningful.},

  abstract = {The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a group of proliferating, embryonic-type cells that generates the aerial parts of the plant. SAMs are highly organized and stable structures that can function for years or even centuries. This is in apparent contradiction to the behaviour of their constituent cells, which continuously proliferate and differentiate. To reconcile the dynamic nature of the cells with the stability of the overall system the existence of elaborate signalling networks has been proposed. This is supported by recent work suggesting that the exchange of signals between cells, rather than a rigidly predetermined genetic program, is required for the establishment and functioning of an organized meristem. Together these interactions form a stable network, set up during embryogenesis, that assures the coordination of cell behaviour throughout development. Besides meristem-specific signalling cascades such as the CLAVATA receptor kinase pathway, which controls meristem size, these interactions involve plant hormones. In particular, cytokinins and auxins are implicated in the maintenance of meristem identity and phyllotaxis, respectively.},

  abstract = {Plants are characterized by their ability to produce new organs post-embryonically throughout their entire life cycle. In particular development of all above-ground organs relies almost entirely on the function of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The SAM performs a dual role by maintaining a pool of undifferentiated cells and simultaneously driving cell differentiation to initiate organogenesis. Both processes require strict coordination between individual cells which leads to formation of reproducible morphological and molecular patterns within SAM. The patterns are formed and maintained in large part due to spatio-temporal variation in signaling of plant hormones auxin and cytokinin resulting in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. Integration of these mechanisms into computational models further identifies the key regulatory interactions involved in SAM function.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

Considering the ubiquity of the Fibonacci numbers in nature, embracing many species of flora, we expect a very simple geometrical law to be responsible. Success in finding such a law does not constitute a proof, but it is at the least an indication that we should look here with mathematical rather than biological eyes. The idea may seem self-evident. However, in the literature it has not yet been honored as the basis for constructing the phyllotaxis in centric, planar models. It is shown here that for the construction of a phyllotactic structure, no special angles or distances need be defined; natural growth functions can be used; planar, cylindrical, conical, and paraboloid constructions are possible within the same model; and constructions leading to accessory sequences and multijugate sequences can also be carried out.},

Combination of the principle of gnomonic growth, where consecutive additions have comparable positions, with a “dragging” principle, where the developing zone follows the apical tip, provides a powerful tool in simulating a wide range of phyllotactic manifestations. The influence of three vital parameters for primordial size, compressibility, and canalization (or annular arrangement) helps in understanding the problem's nature.},

In many organisms, we observe a relatively smooth overall expanding. In the contrary, in the snail house, material is added only on the outside., Plants show patterns in the placement of appendages. The author found a very simple algorithm, that leads to these phyllotactic patterns [4]. The Dislodgement Model explains phyllotaxis via an inversion from expanding to stacking.

His research into the phenomena of growth and procreation in earthly nature was guided by the same yearning to fathom the formal cause which also directed his astronomical research. He singled out one proportion as the divine symbol of procreation: the golden section. Aside from Pacioli's Divina Proportione, Kepler's writings present the only original thoughts about this particular proportion which were published before the nineteenth century.

  abstract = {The plant hormone auxin is thought to provide positional information for patterning during development. It is still unclear, however, precisely how auxin is distributed across tissues and how the hormone is sensed in space and time. The control of gene expression in response to auxin involves a complex network of over 50 potentially interacting transcriptional activators and repressors, the auxin response factors (ARFs) and Aux/IAAs. Here, we perform a large-scale analysis of the Aux/IAA-ARF pathway in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis, where dynamic auxin-based patterning controls organogenesis. A comprehensive expression map and full interactome uncovered an unexpectedly simple distribution and structure of this pathway in the shoot apex. A mathematical model of the Aux/IAA-ARF network predicted a strong buffering capacity along with spatial differences in auxin sensitivity. We then tested and confirmed these predictions using a novel auxin signalling sensor that reports input into the signalling pathway, in conjunction with the published DR5 transcriptional output reporter. Our results provide evidence that the auxin signalling network is essential to create robust patterns at the shoot apex.},

Recent efforts have established a theoretical framework of form emergence at the shoot tip, which has empowered the use of modelling in conjunction with biological approaches to begin to disentangle the biochemical and physical mechanisms controlling form development at the shoot tip. Here, we discuss how these advances get us closer to identifying the construction principles of plant shoot tips. Considering the current limits of our knowledge, we propose a roadmap for developing a general theory of form development at the shoot tip.},

This construction reflects, besides the well-known spiral arcs, two kinds of irregularities, one of which is also observed in natural heads, the other not. The latter kind of irregularities is shown to be due to the semiempirical construction employed and can be avoided by a more pertinent, wholly mathematical construction program, which predicts the whole pattern, including the irregularities that are seen in nature, and only these. In particular, concise formulae are given for the points where visible arcs of different order begin and end, and for the concomitant locations of irregularity shaped junction seeds.},

These incisions were such as to pass through the single superficial layer of meristem cells of the shoot apex, the incipient vascular tissue being left intact. Young primordia thus isolated by tangential incisions developed normally as leaves whereas with deep incisions buds are usually induced. Primordia isolated by four shallow incisions when the apex was not in active growth usually became dispersed and disappeared ; the inception of prospective primordia could also be prevented in this way. The hypothesis relating to the functional activity of the pre-vascular tissue in morphogenesis, which is supported by the results obtained, is discussed in the light of other recent experimental evidence.},

  abstract = {The shoot apices (comprising the essentially embryonic apical meristem and the subjacent region of expansion), in all classes of plants have certain major functional activities in common, e.g., their regulated organogenic activities resulting in the formation of a leafy shoot. Although they may be demonstrably very different in such matters as shape, size, histological constitution, pattern of tissue differentiation, etc., they are essentially alike in their overall organization, i.e., they show a remarkable general homology of organization. The several aspects of apical organization and reactivity are considered from the genetical point of view and it is shown that at least five important criteria of comparison can be enumerated, namely, the size and protoplasmic constitution of the cells of the meristem, the allometric or differential growth pattern, the absolute size of the apex, the position of growth centres, and the nature of the apical reaction system. Against this background, the apex as a dynamic geometric system, the concept of leaf growth centres, and the apex as a system of interrelated zones, apical activity as ascertained by surgical and cytological techniques, and metabolism in the apex, are discussed in some detail. The conclusion is reached that a comprehensive analysis of apical organization is of paramount importance at the present time in that it implies and requires a confluence and integration of facts and concepts from many branches of botanical and physical science and because it is likely to afford the most satisfying means of reconstituting Botany-the science of plants as distinct from the science of particular biological processes-from its several specialized branches.},

  abstract = {A geometrical model of phyllotaxis which simulates the requirements of the next-available-space theory is developed and is shown to reproduce the spiral systems of nature. It also models the evolution of high-order from low-order members of the same type of system and the devolutionary processes that are characteristic of composite capituli. It is shown that all systems which arise de novo from a bare apex are likely to belong to the series m : m+l. This implies that high-order Fibonacci systems do not arise de novo but evolve from 1 : 2 or 2 : 3 systems. It is suggested that the development of whorled systems requires the intervention of secondary constraints that permit the initiation of more than one primordium at each node. Finally, the results are interpreted as showing that the Fibonacci and related limiting divergence angles that are approximated in nature are inevitable consequences of the packing of the primordia as they arise on the edge of the apical dome. The shoot apices of higher plants are seen as hierarchical systems and the phenomena of phyllotaxis as relating to their higher levels. Systems theory suggests that causal mechanisms should be sought in the next lower level, rather than more remotely.},

  abstract = {Cell size and growth kinetics are fundamental cellular properties with important physiological implications. Classical studies on yeast, and recently on bacteria, have identified rules for cell size regulation in single cells, but in the more complex environment of multicellular tissues, data have been lacking. In this study, to characterize cell size and growth regulation in a multicellular context, we developed a 4D imaging pipeline and applied it to track and quantify epidermal cells over 3–4 d in Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristems. We found that a cell size checkpoint is not the trigger for G2/M or cytokinesis, refuting the unexamined assumption that meristematic cells trigger cell cycle phases upon reaching a critical size. Our data also rule out models in which cells undergo G2/M at a fixed time after birth, or by adding a critical size increment between G2/M transitions. Rather, cell size regulation was intermediate between the critical size and critical increment paradigms, meaning that cell size fluctuations decay by ∼75\% in one generation compared with 100\% (critical size) and 50\% (critical increment). Notably, this behavior was independent of local cell–cell contact topologies and of position within the tissue. Cells grew exponentially throughout the first {$>$}80\% of the cell cycle, but following an asymmetrical division, the small daughter grew at a faster exponential rate than the large daughter, an observation that potentially challenges present models of growth regulation. These growth and division behaviors place strong constraints on quantitative mechanistic descriptions of the cell cycle and growth control.},

  author = {Wiss, Danuta and Zagórska-Marek, Beata},
  date = {2012},
  abstract = {The ratio of primordium size to the meristem size ( P/M ratio) is regarded by some geometrical models of phyllotaxis as the parameter, which determines the quality of spiral and whorled patterns of lateral organ arrangement. This assumption was tested on floral meristems in four genets representing four Magnolia taxa: M. × salicifolia , M. stellata , M. denudata and M. acuminata . In successive zones of Magnolia flower, lateral organs are initiated in specific phyllotactic patterns and at specific values of the meristem and primordia sizes. The elements of perianth, usually positioned in three trimerous whorls, are initiated as large primordia on relatively small meristem. The switch in the identity of primordia, from tepals to stamens is accompanied by an abrupt increase in the size of the meristem and decrease in the primordia size. Small values of P/M ratio and frequent occurrence of qualitative transformations of phyllotaxis contribute to the exceptionally rich spectrum of spiral patterns in androecium zone. New spiral patterns emerge when bigger primordia of carpels are initiated on the meristem, which at the same time starts diminishing in size either abruptly ( M. × salicifolia , M. stellata , M. acuminata ) or slowly ( M. denudata ). Spiral patterns identified in gynoecia have lower numbers of parastichies than the patterns of androecia and occur in frequencies specific for the genet. Although noted ranges of the meristem and primordia sizes, justify the occurrence of phyllotactic patterns observed in successive zones of Magnolia flower, they do not explain genet-specific frequencies of the patterns observed in gynoecium zone. The lack of straightforward relationship between frequency of the patterns and P/M ratio in gynoecium suggests that more complex geometrical factors or factors of non-geometrical nature are engaged in determination of Magnolia floral phyllotaxis.},

  abstract = {Plant leaves are arranged around the stem in a beautiful geometry that is called phyllotaxis. In the majority of plants, phyllotaxis exhibits a distichous, Fibonacci spiral, decussate, or tricussate pattern. To explain the regularity and limited variety of phyllotactic patterns, many theoretical models have been proposed, mostly based on the notion that a repulsive interaction between leaf primordia determines the position of primordium initiation. Among them, particularly notable are the two models of Douady and Couder (alternate-specific form, DC1; more generalized form, DC2), the key assumptions of which are that each leaf primordium emits a constant power that inhibits new primordium formation and that this inhibitory effect decreases with distance. It was previously demonstrated by computer simulations that any major type of phyllotaxis can occur as a self-organizing stable pattern in the framework of DC models. However, several phyllotactic types remain unaddressed. An interesting example is orixate phyllotaxis, which has a tetrastichous alternate pattern with periodic repetition of a sequence of different divergence angles: 180°, 90°, −180°, and −90°. Although the term orixate phyllotaxis was derived from Orixa japonica, this type is observed in several distant taxa, suggesting that it may reflect some aspects of a common mechanism of phyllotactic patterning. Here we examined DC models regarding the ability to produce orixate phyllotaxis and found that model expansion via the introduction of primordial age-dependent changes of the inhibitory power is absolutely necessary for the establishment of orixate phyllotaxis. The orixate patterns generated by the expanded version of DC2 (EDC2) were shown to share morphological details with real orixate phyllotaxis. Furthermore, the simulation results obtained using EDC2 fitted better the natural distribution of phyllotactic patterns than did those obtained using the previous models. Our findings imply that changing the inhibitory power is generally an important component of the phyllotactic patterning mechanism.},

  abstract = {Impermanent initials and thus the shift of the axis in the stochastic meristems are postulated to be responsible for ontogenetic phyllotactic diversity in plants. In the gynoecium of Magnolia acuminata the main Fibonacci pattern develops in much less than 50\% of individual generative shoots. There is also an extremely wide spectrum of other patterns, among them even the rarest I, 3, 8, 11 ... pattern is present. Regarded sometimes as "impossible", the pattern has been documented in SEM for the first time. Beside the presence of various patterns, frequent ontogenetic transformations of phyllotaxis have been found in Magnolia. These are indicated by dislocations in the periodic distribution of carpel primordia. In other magnolias, exemplified by M. soulangeana, the Fibonacci pattern prevails, but not as much as in coniferous vegetative shoots, where, as demonstrated earlier, it reaches 95\%. Other pattern numbers are also different. This suggests the involvement of the genetic factor and may be attributed to the higher frequency of discontinuous phyllotactic transformations in some species. The stochastic character of the meristem is perhaps more pronounced in some plants, which leads in turn to more frequent transitions and greater pattern diversity.},

  abstract = {Polycystine radiolaria are among few protistan groups that possess a comprehensive fossil record available for study by micropaleontologists. The Polycystinea and the Acantharea, whose skeletons do not become fossilized, were once members of the class “Radiolaria” (“Radiolaria” sensu lato: Polycystinea, Phaeodarea, and Acantharea) originally proposed by Haeckel but are now included in the superclass Actinopoda. Phylogenetic relationships within this superclass remain largely enigmatic. We investigated the evolutionary relationship of the Acantharea and the Polycystinea to other protists using phylogenetic analyses of 16S-like ribosomal RNA (rRNA) coding regions. We circumvented the need to culture these organisms by collecting and maintaining reproductive stages that contain many copies of their genomic DNA. This strategy facilitated extraction of genomic DNA and its purification from symbiont and prey DNA. Phylogenetic trees inferred from comparisons of 16S-like coding regions do not support a shared history between the Acantharea and the Polycystinea. However, the monophyly of the Acantharea and the separate monophyly of the Polycystinea (Spumellarida) are well supported by our molecular-based trees. The acantharian lineage branches among crown organisms whereas the polycystine lineage diverges before the radiation of the crown groups. We conclude that the Actinopoda does not represent a monophyletic evolutionary assemblage and recommend that this taxonomic designation be discarded.},
