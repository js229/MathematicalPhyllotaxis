In 2012, Mark and Ang Davis asked me to give a talk in the pub for Bollington Science Festival which started me wondering why it wasn't possible to explain why plants had Fibonacci numbers, even though I'd believed twenty years earlier that this was a mathematically solved problem. Around the same time, Erinma Ochu of the MOSI Turing's Sunflowers project was amazed not only that no-one knew how to breed Lucas sunflowers, but that I was surprised by the question.  
Julia Gog  made some usefully mathematical remarks on a very early draft of the lattice theory chapters, and  Paul Glendinning  long ago gave some advice on how to phrase my challenge to the Fundamental Theorem of Phyllotaxis.
Christopher Golé told me about his work with Stéphane Douady on the stability of rhombic lattices with three disks. Stéphane, together with  Annemiek Cornelissen, made me welcome on a visit to the CNRS Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes. Tamsin Spelman and several of her colleagues at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Cambridge made helpful comments, and Hugo Tavares and Katie Abley's neighbourly support was particularly nourishing.   Philip Maini graciously hosted me in the Mathematical Biology seminar at the University of Oxford. and Andrew Krause, Mark Muldoon and Ronjoy Adhikari listened patiently and constructively to my pitches for this material. Phil Ramsden currently holds the record for the fastest finding of a mistake.  Adam Swinton has been a patient and critical reader of several drafts. 
Diana Gillooly and David Tranah, as editors at two major university Presses,  offered supportive, engaged and productive publication advice over a rather extended period. But in the end it was Alain Goriely who on his own initiative invited me to join the Springer Texts series, and I thank him and the Editorial Board for support for this book. Christopher Golé, Stéphane Douady and Richard Schwartz gave constructive advice as reviewers for Springer. 
%I expect to be able to write that Donna Chernyk shepherded this through the press at Springer Nature with friendly efficiency.


Thinking about this subject allowed me to rediscover a delight in mathematics. But love of mathematics alone would never have got this book finished over its many years in the writing. For rediscovering the love of almost everything else, including getting things done, I thank in particular Emma Anderson. But it was the questions  of \textit{all} these people and more, by email, in the pub, the museum and the seminar room, that shaped this attempt at answers.  Thanks to you all.
