Mark and Ang Davis extended an invitation to give a talk in the pub for Bollington Science Festival in 2012 which started me wondering why it wasn't possible to explain why plants had Fibonacci numbers, even though Keith Devlin had written twenty years earlier that this was a mathematically solved problem. Around the same time, Erinma Ochu, then of the MOSI Turing's Sunflowers project, was amazed not only that no-one knew how to breed Lucas sunflowers, but that I was surprised by the question.  
I'm particularly grateful to Julia Gog who made some usefully critical remarks on a very early draft of the lattice theory chapters, and to Paul Glendinning who long ago gave some advice on how to phrase my challenge to the Fundamental Theorem of Phyllotaxis.
Christopher Golé generously gave me some snatched time and told me about his recent work with Stéphane Douady on the stability of rhombic lattices with three disks. Tamsin Spelman and several of her colleagues at the Sainsbury Laboratory made helpful comments, and Hugo Tavares and Katie Abley's neighbourly support was particularly nourishing. Adam Swinton has been a patient and critical reader of several drafts.   Philip Maini generously hosted me in the Mathematical Biology seminar at the University of Oxford. Both Diana Gillooly and David Tranah offered supportive, engaged and productive publication advice, and Andrew Krause, Mark Muldoon and Alain Goriely have listened patiently and constructively to my pitches for this material. Phil Ramsden currently holds the record for the fastest finding of a mistake. 
It was the questions of all these people, in the pub, the museum and the seminar room, that shaped this attempt at answers.  Thanks to you all.
