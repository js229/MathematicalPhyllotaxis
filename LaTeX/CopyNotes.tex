This is my private draft number \jdraftnumber\  of \textit{A Textbook of Mathematical Phyllotaxis}. A first edition, privately printed in 2023 with the ISBN 978-0-9931789-6-2, is no longer available. A second edition is to be published in November 2025 by Springer Nature with ISBNs (print) 978-3-031-94012-5 and (ebook) 978-3-031-94013-2 and DOI {https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-94013-2}.  I have granted Springer Nature an exclusive copyright license to that second edition. 

This third edition collects changes postdating the Springer edition and has not been peer-reviewed.
